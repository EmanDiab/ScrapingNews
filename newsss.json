{"title": "The app that lets you pay to control another person's life", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57085557", "author": null, "article_text": "When writer Brandon Wong recently couldn't decide what takeaway to order one evening, he asked his followers on social media app NewNew to choose for him.\nThose that wanted to get involved in the 24-year-old's dinner dilemma paid $5 (\u00a33.50) to vote in a poll, and the majority verdict was that he should go for Korean food, so that was what he bought.\n\"I couldn't decide between Chinese or Korean, so it was very helpful,\" says Mr Wong, who lives in Edmonton, Canada. \"I have also used NewNew polls to decide what clothes I should wear that day, and lots of other personal stuff.\n\"I joined back in March, and I post [polls] three or four times a week. I've now had more than 1,700 total votes.\"\nNewNew is the brainchild of Los Angeles-based entrepreneur Courtne Smith. The app, which is still in its \"beta\" or pre-full release stage, describes itself as \"a human stock market where you buy shares in the lives of real people, in order to control their decisions and watch the outcome\".\nFor many of us that sounds a bit ominous, but the reality is actually far less alarming. It is aimed at what it calls \"creators\" - writers, painters, musicians, fashion designers, bloggers etc.\nIt is designed as a way for them to connect far more closely with their fans or followers than on other social media services and, importantly, monetise that connection.\nWhen a so-called creator sets up a NewNew account and attracts followers, he or she is encouraged to ask them via video clips to vote on aspects of both their work and personal life.\nMr Wong, who writes fiction on the Wattpad website and app, has also used NewNew votes to decide on what genre to write about next, plus character names and plot developments.\nWhenever a vote is cast the creator gets the money minus NewNew's undisclosed commission.\nThe creator sets the question and a choice of two answers. Their followers get to vote, and can pay to do so as many times as they like. They don't get their money back, regardless of which way the result goes.\nIn addition to voting, followers can also pay extra - from $20 - to ask a NewNew creator to do something of their choosing, such as naming a character in a book after them. But the creator can reject all of these \"bids\", and if they do so then the follower doesn't have to part with the money.\nWhile other apps such as Wishbone ask members of the public to vote on things, NewNew says that what it offers - the chance to pay to vote on aspects of a person's work and personal life - is unique.\nBut will NewNew, which only launched two months ago and currently has fewer than 100 creators on board, have mass appeal? Social media expert Matt Navarra says he isn't sure.\n\"NewNew feels a bit like if TikTok met reality TV hit Big Brother and they had a baby, and both of those were phenomenally popular,\" he says.\n\"However, it feels a little bit gimmicky, and I wonder if the novelty value will be short-lived. Yet if choosing what outfit a stranger wears gives Generation Z a buzz then it could be on to something.\"\n is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.\nCo-founder and chief executive Ms Smith, a Canadian, has big plans for NewNew, and has some heavyweight backers. Investors include Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of PayPal, and the first outside person to put money into Facebook.\nOthers with a stake in the business include leading US tech investment fund Andreessen Horowitz, and Hollywood actor Will Smith (no relation to Courtne). Snapchat has also given technical support.\n\"NewNew provides a two-way beneficial split,\" says Ms Smith. \"Five dollars is a small amount of money to pay to have fun and get a reward.\n\"[For example], knowing that your vote meant that one of your favourite artists painted an artwork in blue and pink would be a really cool thing for a lot of people. And for the creator you are building a community of people who are so in tune with what you do, and are going to become your evangelists.\n\"So when you are ready to sell that book or piece of art they are going to be there helping you to promote it, because, technically, they helped to make it in their own way.\"\nWhile many people might question how \"beneficial\" it is to followers to vote on aspects of a creator's daily life, Ms Smith adds that it only further strengthens the bond between the two sides. \"Almost the more mundane the questions, the more interested you get in the person. It feels relatable.\"\nMs Smith has been working on NewNew for the past two years. The idea developed out of a previous app she set up called Suprize. That asked members of the public to vote on what prizes it would give away to game-playing contestants.\nPrior to becoming an entrepreneur she spent more than 10 years working for Canadian rapper Drake, first as his assistant, and then as a member of his management team. The pair were friends growing up in Toronto and she says that he is following NewNew's development.\nBusiness psychologist Stuart Duff, a partner at UK firm Pearn Kandola, says that NewNew sounds fun, and should \"create special bonds between creators and their followers\". But he adds that in rare cases some bonds might become unhealthy.\n\"It may not take long for a creator to go to more and more extreme lengths to attract votes from their followers, ending in potentially self-damaging or humiliating scenarios,\" he says.\nA NewNew spokeswoman says that the company \"reserves the right to completely remove and ban any person and their content should they go against guidelines\".\nShe adds: \"The safety of all people on the platform is a top priority for us. The company reviews all content posted internally, and through AI, to flag any inappropriate content.\"\nAndr\u00e9 Patrick, a 34-year-old from Toronto, is a follower on NewNew. He says he joined initially so he could interact with a video streamer that he liked.\n\"NewNew is a cool new way to feel closer to a person, and it shows a different side to people that you don't always see,\" he says. \nSo could NewNew become the next big thing in social media? Will thousands or even millions of us start voting on what our favourite novelist or musician has for dinner?\nIt'll be down to you to decide."},

Only 1,054 of those cases were of the Indian variant, known as B.1.617.2.\nDr Jenny Harries told the Andrew Marr Show the study was \"very good news\". \nThe chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency said the study is the \"first real-world evidence of vaccine effectiveness\" against the variant.\nAsked about the discrepancy between the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccine results, she said a key factor to consider was that the \"different vaccines were given to slightly different groups of people\". \n\"The Pfizer vaccine was rolled out initially, because it had to be kept at ultra-low temperatures, to - for example - healthcare workers, who tended to be younger,\" she said. \n\"This is an all-age study. Whereas AstraZeneca went out to older groups of individuals who were unable to come into main centres.\"   \nAs the virus changes, protection against infection was always going to be the first thing that slips.\nSo the fact that the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines offer such a high degree of protection against the Indian variant after the second dose is very reassuring given experts expect it to become dominant.\nBut what are the implications of the drop in effectiveness of the first dose where the Indian variant is concerned?\nGiven it's expected to become the dominant variant in the UK, it's now even more important people get their second jab.\nThe more difficult question to answer is what this means for the speed of the route back to normality.\nIts ability to evade the vaccines even by a small degree will be a factor in how more transmissible this variant is here.\nThere are also other biological reasons why it might find it easier to spread.\nBut this does not necessarily mean we will see a surge in cases and, crucially, hospital admissions - the protection vaccines give us against serious illness will be much much higher than their ability to block mild infections.\nThe Indian variant certainly gives the virus a bit more of an advantage, but it doesn't mean the vaccines won't win out.\nThe study looked at data from all age groups from 5 April, to cover the period since the Indian variant emerged.\nThere is not enough data to estimate how effective the vaccine is against severe outcomes for the Indian variant, PHE said.\nDr Jamie Lopez Bernal, consultant medical epidemiologist at PHE and the study's lead author, said there was higher confidence in the data from the first vaccine dose than that from the second as \"there are bigger numbers that have been vaccinated with one dose\".\nProf Susan Hopkins, PHE's Covid-19 strategic response director, said the data trend was \"quite clear\" and was heading in the \"right direction\".\n and 22 million have had their second.\nSome 13,000 deaths and 39,100 hospitalisations have been prevented in the UK due to the vaccination programme up to 9 May, according to PHE analysis.\nIt comes as more than 1.3 million more people in England have become registered users of the NHS app since it was announced that it would allow them to show proof they had received a Covid-19 vaccine, taking its user base to 4.8 million. \nThe app is separate from the NHS Covid-19 contact-tracing app."},

A 10-year-old once asked what a duck was, while a pupil - spotting cows in the field - said: \"Look at those horses.\"\n\"As a school, we're in a very built-up area in Blackpool,\" Kim explains. \"We've had some very extreme examples of our children with nature.\"\nWestminster Primary Academy is in an area with few green spaces where wildlife and nature are in short supply. \nAlthough many children live only minutes from the beach, they may not get to spend much time there. And while Blackpool is surrounded by spectacular countryside, such as the Forest of Bowland, Kim says many parents don't have cars or can't afford public transport.\n\"They're just not getting the opportunities a lot of other children would get,\" she adds. \"So, we thought, 'well, let's bring nature to them'.\"\nKim is now outdoor education lead at the primary school, which became a Nature Friendly School two years ago. The scheme, which aims to make school grounds greener and wilder, is a partnership between The Wildlife Trusts, mental health charity YoungMinds, and several other nature organisations.\nThe project trains teachers to deliver outdoor classes, inspiring their pupils to learn more about environmental challenges and the natural world, and encouraging teamwork, social skills, confidence and creativity.\nNature Friendly Schools has already worked with 90 schools in areas with high levels of social deprivation, giving thousands of pupils the opportunity to learn and play in nature.\nThe leaders hope to expand the programme this year to help children find solace in nature after the hardships of lockdowns.\nThe Wildlife Trusts chief executive Craig Bennett says spending time outside, engaging with and learning about nature, is paramount to children's education. \n\"Sadly, so many children go to school in areas where there is very little access to green space,\" he says.  \n\"At The Wildlife Trusts, we want to break down barriers that inhibit children from spending time in nature - including during the school day.\"\nWestminster Academy now has an outdoor classroom as well as a pond, more trees and wildflowers, a trim-trail and an outdoor gym. \nThe teachers incorporate nature into the curriculum as much as they can, says Kim. \"What we're trying to do as a school is to get our children to like, respect and admire nature, so that - as they grow up - they understand the significance and importance of keeping it safe and keeping our planet safe.\"\nIn lessons outside, children learn about threats to bees, including climate change, habitat loss and pesticides. \nPond dipping is a perennial favourite, not just to identify water creatures, but to learn about physical forces through studying floating objects.\n\"The children absolutely love it,\" she says. \"A lot of them say it doesn't feel like learning even though we know we're learning and that's what makes it so good for them.\"\nWhen Kim asked her young charges to say what they liked about outdoor learning, the responses were heart-warming. \n\"One girl said, 'I just love discovering new creatures.' Another explained, 'When I'm outside, it doesn't feel like learning, because it's so much fun and I just know that my brain is getting bigger'.\" \nFollow \n on Twitter."},

Within minutes of the all-star, pay-per-view show starting on Saturday night, things went badly wrong.\nThousands of ticketholders received errors saying \"invalid code\" or \"access denied\". Pretty soon, fans supplanted the official hashtag #LiveAtWorthyFarm with the altogether more accurate #NotLiveAtWorthyFarm.\nIt took two hours to sort the technical problems out, by which point many viewers had given up and gone to watch the UK \n Again. \nEventually, organisers abandoned the ticketing system altogether and made the concert free for anyone to watch. You could rewind the stream a little - but poor old Wolf Alice and Michel Kiwanuka, who kicked off the event, were lost down the back of the internet sofa.\nI entered half-way through a blistering set from Bristol punk band Idles, and was instantly thrust into the sweaty atmosphere of a subterranean club gig, as a free-roaming camera captured the jostling aggro of a mosh-pit.\nLike many bands on the bill, they played in a tight circular formation, making up for the lack of an audience by performing to each other. It was a minor (but smart) modification that stopped the sets feeling staged and sterile. \nHaim were up next, bringing some LA cool to proceedings, as they ran through the laid-back grooves of their latest album, Women In Music, Pt III.\nSongs like Summer Girl and The Steps were custom built for outdoor venues, and the band were clearly relishing the chance to give them an airing from inside Glastonbury's legendary Stone Circle.\n\"This is our favourite festival in the whole entire world,\" said singer Danielle Haim, who was otherwise a frontwoman of very few words. \nColdplay took up their rightful position in front of (the frame of) the Pyramid Stage just after 21:00 BST, illuminating the fields with a spectacular light and laser show.\nFour-time headliners, their set list was typically faultless, cramming in Fix You, The Scientist, Viva La Vida, Clocks and A Sky Full Of Stars into a 30-minute slot - as well as a delicate new song, Human Heart, performed with US R&B singers We Are King.\n\"This is very weird but very fun,\" said Martin, pointing out he was essentially playing to \"thousands and thousands of cows\".\nHe jokingly played in some canned applause, but there was no hiding the fact no-one was watching. There were none of Glastonbury's traditional flags, no flares, no mud, no cups trampled into the ground, and no chemically-altered maniacs trying to make you dance with them... \nOnly one thing remained consistent: Coldplay were absolutely drenched in rain.\n\"If there's a day you didn't want to stand in a field, it's today,\" laughed Martin. \nEven so, the sight of the festival's favourite band playing alone was strangely melancholy. Take it from someone who knows, gingerly singing The Scientist to your 10-year-old's favourite teddy will never be the same as belting it out in a field of happy strangers. \nDon't get me wrong, though. The teddy loved it.\nColdplay were the de facto headliners, taking the time slot when (if all had gone to plan) most people were likely to tune in. After they cleared the stage, things became a little more sedate.\nDamon Albarn turned up in a mullet to play a set almost entirely devoid of Blur songs -  thanks a lot, Damon - while debuting music from his forthcoming project The Nearer the Fountain, More Pure the Stream Flows, which is \"inspired by the landscapes of Iceland\".\nAt a normal festival, this was the point where you'd have wandered off to see who was playing the jazz stage or to queue up for a doughnut, but the live-stream meant we were all hostage to Damon's wistful meanderings. I certainly didn't switch over to watch the Eurovision voting for a couple of minutes, and anyone who says otherwise is a liar, OK?\nJorja Smith brought the mood back up, exuding a breezy mellowness on songs like Blue Lights and Be Honest; after which Radiohead's Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood debuted their new side-project The Smile.\nInitially, they sounded quite a lot like Radiohead - in fact, the first track was an unreleased Radiohead track called Skirting On The Surface - but as their eight-song set wore on, things got pleasantly weirder, drawing on punk and math rock and spiralling jazz riffs. \nAnd while most latter-day Radiohead material has been a slow burn, Yorke's new melodies (and Greenwood's restless basslines) had a compelling immediacy. A debut album can't be far off.\nBack outside, Kano brought some much-needed eccentricity, playing his grime anthem 3 Wheel-Ups with a marching band on a Billie Jean dancefloor. \nHe maintained a ferocious energy for the next 30 minutes, powering through apocalyptic versions of Teardrops and Free Years Later before emerging into the light with the funky set-closers Can't Hold We Down and SYM.\nA much-needed shot of adrenaline, it perfectly set up the final act - an after-hours DJ set by Honey Dijon, filmed on a customised bus in the festival's Block9 area.\nAs she dropped tunes by Diana Ross and Lady Gaga, a small crew of socially-distanced dancers strutted around outside the bus, a sight that instantly transported me to the dying moments of Glastonbury 2019. \nBack then, while queuing up to leave the site, I watched three spaced out festival-goers desperately fanning the embers of their weekend by throwing shapes to a burger van's portable radio, insisting the owner was the \"best DJ we've heard all weekend, mate\".\nAs Jarvis Cocker said in one of tonight's spoken-word interludes, that's exactly what makes Glastonbury great.\n\"All those extra-curricular activities you just discover while wandering around, they're often the best bits of the weekend.\"\nIt made me nostalgic for the festival all over again; and even more determined to make the pilgrimage if it comes back, as planned, next year. \n\"We are going to throw everything at 2022,\" organiser Emily Eavis told the BBC earlier this week. \"The light is coming in. \n\"We're able to move out of this very awkward time and plan to be back in fields again; and to be watching live music; and camping for five days outside with 200,000 other people.\"\nAnd if, in the meantime, someone doesn't start a band called \"Invalid Code\" and get themselves onto the bill, something will have gone terribly wrong."},

Firms, both abroad and in Australia, refused. \nEnabling backdoors would be bad, says Jenny Afia, head of Schillings' legal team: \"Any legally-enforced weakening of the encryption algorithm, or vulnerability placed within the software...would potentially allow criminals to exploit [it].\n\"It is worth bearing in mind that having end-to-end encryption in place has already prevented a lot of crime.\"\nSupporters of encryption also point out that it provides a secure means of communication for dissidents and whistleblowers and making keys available could put them in jeopardy.\nEdward Snowden, the NSA whistleblower who first highlighted mass surveillance to the public, \n if governments prevent end-to-end encryption or insist on backdoors.  \nNetsweeper in Canada catalogues the internet to help schools and internet service providers block harmful content.\nIt sees a quarter of the world's internet traffic and is in 37% of British schools, scanning 100 million new URLs daily. Up to 300 URLs are reported to IWF daily. \n\"To date, governments have left the large tech companies alone - probably because they didn't understand them as much as they do now,\" says Netsweeper's chief executive Perry Roach.\n\"But if we don't enable law enforcement with sophisticated tools, it will allow criminals, scammers, paedophiles and terrorists to move across the internet undetected.\" \nSoftware engineer Brian Bason founded US firm Bark after giving his sons their first mobile phones. \nBark uses AI neural networks to analyse text messages and social media in milliseconds for bullying, online predation, child abuse, signs of depression and suicidal ideas. \nChildren have to agree to hand over their login credentials, but only relevant sections of messages are sent in alerts to parents and schools.\nBark has informed the FBI of nearly a thousand child predators over the last five years.\n\"The reality is end-to-end encryption will drastically reduce the amount of CSAM material reported to authorities,\" Mr Bason tells the BBC. \"To me, the trade-off is not worth it.\"\nPerhaps these firms disagree because their business models rely on having unfettered access to data pipelines. \nHowever, former UK and US intelligence agency staff tell the BBC there are other successful methods investigators can use if end-to-end encryption is introduced, like phishing, where users are tricked into visiting fake websites and handing over login credentials.\nInternet giants should use machine learning to detect child predator behaviour on the device or server, they add, which wouldn't break encryption, as it occurs only after the message has been decrypted. \nThorn, a US foundation that develops software to combat child exploitation, identifies eight child victims and 215 pieces of child abuse material per day.  \nSarah Gardner, VP of external affairs at Thorn, suggests using \n - a form of encryption that lets users perform computations on encrypted data, without first decrypting it.\nAnother option would be to invest in better solutions, she adds.\nEdinburgh-based Cyan Forensics, which uses statistical sampling to scan suspects' devices for CSAM content in just 10 minutes, agrees.\n\"End-to-end encryption is here already and it's neither good nor bad,\" says Cyan Forensics' co-founder and chief executive Ian Stevenson.\n\"However, there is a dire need for broader protocols to ensure the safety of children online.\"\nFormer detective constable Alan McConnell, who worked on more than a hundred child sex abuse cases, left Police Scotland to teach Cyan about the problems the police face.\nAs a result of his work, a major UK police force used Cyan's software to detect CSAM material on an ex-offender's computer in March. The individual was found to have surreptitiously installed cameras at a club used by children. \nHowever, a senior German prosecutor says his biggest problem is getting tech firms to play ball. \n\"We're addressing all the big tech firms - please help us,\" says Markus Hartmann, director of North Rhine-Westphalia's central cybercrime department.\n\"You hear they have these big teams fighting digital crimes, and I wonder, why don't they file any complaints with law enforcement?\"\nHis unit recently busted a child pornography ring, charging 65 suspects and rescuing a 13-year-old child. \nThey were aided by Microsoft, which scanned its database of Skype users to locate the suspects' IP addresses.\nMr Hartmann is surprisingly in favour of encryption.\n\"If you break encryption, put in backdoors or ban it, then you're doing more harm than good... and I doubt the guys we are really going after, will not be able to get around it,\" he says.\n\"Even as a prosecutor, I could set up my own end-to-end encrypted network in two days, routed through public libraries.\""},

Could it be because we have all spent the past year forever seeing our reflection on work video calls?\n\"We know that more and more people have been on social media, and conference calls, because they've been stuck at home,\" says Dr Helena Lewis-Smith, a psychology researcher specialising in body image at the University of the West of England.\n\"There's a tool on Zoom, for example, allowing people to smooth their skin's appearance. People who are more likely to press that button during these calls are more likely to be invested in their appearance, and have a worse body image.\"\nThe growing trend of male cosmetic surgery is more pronounced in the US, \n.\n\"Our society places a premium on youthfulness,\" says Dr Alan Matarasso, a previous president of the American Association of Plastic Surgeons. \"Men are as concerned as anybody else about their appearance.\n\"And there's been a change in the culture of male preening - it's become socially acceptable for men, whereas before it might not have been so.\"\nThe changing patterns of modern work also provides a more hard-nosed business logic, he thinks. \n\"We're not in a world any more where somebody lives in the same house, or works in the same job, their whole lives,\" says Dr Matarasso. \"And whether you subscribe to this or not, many of us judge people on first impressions.\"\nI hadn't been pressing any image-altering buttons on video calls, but I was curious to see what the fuss was about. I had already discussed my plan with friends and family, whose responses ranged from smirks and alarm, to fascination, and in one case - ill-concealed envy.\nPlastic surgery does start to feel like the front-line of an undeclared culture war, with prejudice and shaming liberally dispensed on both sides. \nFor those taking the plunge, probably the most popular intervention (for men and women) is Botox. Also known as botulinum toxin, it's the trade name of a protein that in much larger volumes is active in the disease, botulism.\nBut don't let that necessarily put you off. Applied minimally to your face, it's billed as helping to smooth out wrinkles, such as crow's feet and frown lines, freezing muscles for a period of months at a time. \n\"We have older successful businessmen, and the owner of a racing car company,\" says Dr Salinda Johnson, describing some of the clients who visit her London Cosmetic Clinic. \"Older men are more concerned about ageing. And we also have younger City workers who want to look more handsome and more attractive.\"\nAfter a brief consultation, I'm encouraged to lie back on her couch, receive a generous smear of anti-septic across my forehead, and then a series of pin-prick jabs. It's a very fine needle.\nI didn't find the injections uncomfortable, although I was warned of possible short-term headaches, and to avoid vigorous exercise over the coming hours. But I'm still debating with myself whether my lines and creases aren't simply an indication of experience or character.\n\"There's only so much character we want to have!\" argues Dr Matarasso, who says that for many of his male patients, the experience can feel transformative. But he warns he's not in the business of providing eternal youth.\n\"We're here to make people look as good as they feel. We really can't turn back the clock on a 65-year-old and make them look like they're 25.\"\nSocial and the mainstream media are awash with salutary tales about plastic surgery gone wrong. There are no shortage of highly-reputable clinicians offering treatment, but there's also an army of untrained practitioners, particularly in less-regulated countries, drawn by the huge profits to be made in this industry.\n is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast.\nWhile the risks associated with a Botox injection are low, anyone planning treatment is urged to check thoroughly the qualifications of those providing it, as well as the options for aftercare. \n\"TV shows and social media are essentially normalising what can be very risky procedures,\" warns Dr Lewis-Smith. \"People do experience some degree of increased happiness and body satisfaction [from cosmetic surgery] short-term, but we don't know how they're going to feel five or 10 years down the line.\"\nShe is concerned about the trend among both men and women to place so much effort into perfecting themselves, especially when fashions around appearance and body shape are prone to change.\n\"Now it's all about the Kardashians, 10 years ago it was Kate Moss,\" she says. \"Think about those people's different body types. Women might now want to have buttock implants, breast implants, lip fillers, but what happens after a few years when we're sold a different ideal?\"\nTwo weeks after my Botox injections I don't see any big changes in my own appearance, although I do have a general numbness in my forehead. The muscle-freezing will help to inhibit the creation of future wrinkles, I'm told.\nBotox is actually more preventative than transformative, and will require another round after three or four months if I'm determined to maintain the effect. This is said to be how many of Hollywood's leading men have held on to their youthful skin for longer than you'd imagine. Although some, like George Clooney, claim not to be tempted. \nThe global market \n  For Dr Lewis-Smith the concern is where this relentless pursuit of cosmetic improvement is leading us. \n\"We're trying to adapt what we're born with for the beauty industry to make money,\" she says. \"So it does make me scared to be honest.\n\"We are giving them our money because we want to feel better about ourselves, and to match those ideals with what they show us. They're trading on and exploiting people's dissatisfaction.\"\n."},

This attempts to simulate the presence of a trained captain in the little submarine's programming. \nThis is AI working in total isolation from human contact, not least because maintaining strict radio silence is critical to a submarine's covert role. The technical principle here is machine learning, showing an AI program examples of how a task should be performed until it has embedded the right actions in its own repertoire. \nTo do this, MarineAI is using a huge IBM AC922 supercomputer, \"a monster, one of the biggest in the South-West of England\" Mr Thompson boasts. In contrast the on-board brain of the submarine resides in a 15cm square box and relies on an Nvidia chip often found driving computer games.\n\"We built it off the back of the Nvidia chip because it's highly energy efficient,\" says Mr Thompson. Just like a tiny but powerful Raspberry Pi device used to teach schoolchildren basic programming tasks this approach takes up very little power. And keeping power consumption to the bare minimum is critical to making the submarine's battery last. \nIt's clear that the Ministry of Defence is paying very close attention to battery technology for this project. So far MarineAI is relying on existing technology derived from car batteries. But it notes that research in this field is leaping forward. \nThe AI content of the computer should prioritise tasks. The project envisages a boat that can travel to an area of the sea-bed to search for mines or plant a sophisticated electronic intelligence-gathering package or stay in place and scour its environment for information on a hostile navy. \nSo MarineAI is creating a decision-making capacity for the submarine's brain. It will know how much battery life is left and how to weigh that against prevailing weather conditions and sea states, reaching a logical decision on whether to sail on or return home in the face of strong tides. \nThe project has oceans left to cross. For instance, how can the submarine detect small objects on the surface such as jet-skis?  \nAll of these dilemmas are small beer for human submarine captains. Commander Ryan Ramsey captained the hunter-killer HMS Turbulent and taught on the Perisher, a five-month-long course the navy uses to push prospective submarine skippers to the limit.  \nThis decides if they are fit to command 100 or more submariners working punishing watches consisting of six hours on, six hours off for the duration of a long patrol. \nCdr Ramsey worked in AI after leaving the navy and can see where smart software and human instinct might not produce the same response.\n\"AI will struggle to match human decision-making skills. There are lots of submariners skills you can transfer to it, but you have to accept that the first generation will not be perfect.\" \nHe cites how he would study opposing Nato submarine commanders he went up against in exercises, learning how far each individual was prepared to push a vessel. \"The reality is that if you don't know how a guy operates he will find your submarine before you find him. You can't replicate that emotional input in AI.\" \nIf the XLUUV is ever to be armed that might create serious problems. The decision to fire a torpedo rests on a huge reserve of each officer's instincts and experience. \"If you leave that to a rules-based system you might escalate things. There is just so much to learn about the underwater battlespace.\"\nIn the future Cdr Ramsey believes submarines will be equipped with the ability to launch their own autonomous vessels. The next generation of surface warships entering service are already planned to feature mission-bays for launching uncrewed vessels. And autonomous submarines can be deployed by transport aircraft, giving the batteries a rest and the XLUUV a global reach. \nThe longer-term prospect for AI-controlled submarines is rosy, says Cdr Ramsey. \"I can see a way to do a Perisher for AI. Get the right people to recreate their experiences in a simulator and let the AI learn from that, including human decisions that might be wrong. Give it ten years' worth of data and it will be able to build its own rules.\" \nThis simulator-based course for computer code promises another big benefit. \"The AI can test out its own rules without any risk. My worry with autonomous submarines is the political impact if the vessel does something wrong or gets caught in hostile waters,\" he says.   \nPlymouth's trial submarine is based on an MSubs design known as the S201. And across the Atlantic, Boeing is building a series of large uncrewed submersibles as the US Navy works out how these vessels can be used. \nFormer submariners talk about the degree of teamwork and close comradeship required to perform their missions. AI cannot replicate this, but it does not need to if all it is doing is saving sailors from exhausting and repetitive tasks better allocated to a drone. \nThe Royal Navy is coy about its plans for this technology and is committed to a next generation of crewed nuclear submarines. Yet the work of Plymouth's AI pioneers may see their most perilous missions delegated to an AI program that never goes off watch. "},

In 2019, there were almost 400,000 foreign visitors.\nFollowing a collapse in numbers during the pandemic, tourism is on the increase again.\nOn 25 March, Seychelles announced that visitors could enter without the need to quarantine, although a negative Covid test is still needed and entry restrictions apply for some countries.\nMore than 14,000 visitors arrived in April, far more than in March. But the government has rejected suggestions that this could have led to a rise in cases.\n\"There is also no evidence that tourists are bringing new infections into Seychelles,\" said Dr Gedeon."},

{"title": "Ladi Ladebo: A pioneer of Nigerian cinema", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-57156147", "author": null, "article_text": "His death in London came nearly 20 years after his last directorial effort, Heritage. The film had its UK premiere at the Khalili Theatre of the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas) in 2004. \nCentred on the trade in African artefacts fuelled by the international art market, the film feels prescient in light of the current debate about the restitution of African art treasures from museums of the West. \nLadebo felt strongly about the issue, comparing looted African art to someone stealing the Statue of Liberty. \nHe argued that the loss of artefacts had an adverse impact on societal cohesion, as the objects were made for cultural purposes and their absence could only be detrimental, due to the removal of vital information pertaining to a people's journey. \nHe did not spare the Nigerian elite in what he called the \"social crisis\" of art theft, pointing to acts of complicity in the illicit trade. \nHe was similarly unimpressed by African governments, which he accused of lacking seriousness about arts and culture, decrying their failure to accord museums their proper place in the education system. \nLadebo believed a realistic outcome for Nigeria would be part-return or part-purchase arrangements with Western museums. He further suggested periodical travelling exhibitions that would allow people to see the artefacts in their homeland. \nBut the ground has since shifted significantly. The debate over the Benin Bronzes has reached unprecedented levels, and developments are unfolding which might have seemed unthinkable a couple of years ago. \nGermany is to return looted Benin Bronzes to Nigeria; so is the University of Aberdeen as well as several institutions, especially museums, from the UK to Europe and America. \nIn the current atmosphere, it is reasonable to think that Ladebo, too, would be much more strident today in his reckoning of an issue that preoccupied him so much he made a film about it, pumping much of his family savings into the project. \nThe director and producer had hoped to work with Swiss backers to make a series of documentaries titled, Who Owns Art and Culture? However, it does not appear anything came of the arrangement. \nHeritage suffered the fate of much of his filmography - made with passion and idealism but seen by few. \nBorn Raymond Oladipupo Ladebo in the city of Ijebu-Ode in Nigeria's Ogun State, the director obtained business and marketing degrees from US universities, and worked as a media analyst and accounts executive before going into films in collaboration with African-American actor Ossie Davis, who described Ladebo as a son-in-law. \nTheir greatest collaboration was on the film Countdown At Kusini (1976), co-written by Ladebo and directed by Davis, who also starred in the film alongside Ruby Dee. \nCountdown At Kusini was the first of its kind in many ways, and its unique place in the history of black cinema is now an acknowledged fact. \n\"The first film to be made by Black Americans and Africans working together on African soil, Kusini gives us a rare glimpse of the modern reality of Africa. All film was done in and around Lagos, Nigeria,\" noted the US newspaper, Ann Arbor Sun, in 1976. \nA conscious Pan-African production conceived to counter stereotypical portrayals of African Americans particularly in the Blaxploitation films of the early 1970s, Kusini was the first film ever to be funded by a black women's organisation, the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, in a case of crowdfunding and media activism that was ahead of its time. \nBut for all the good intentions, Kusini's backers had not banked on non-committal Hollywood distributors and theatres, as the film was pulled summarily from the cinema by Columbia Pictures. \nWhen Kusini was shown at the Diaspora Festival of Black and Independent Film in the US in 2018, it was its first screening in 30 years. \nMany older Nigerians fondly remember Ladebo's iconic film, Bisi - Daughter of the River (1977), a vehicle for British-Nigerian actress, Patti Boulaye, in the high point of Nigerian cinema.\nThe economic downturn and Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) of the 1980s led to a steep decline in Nigeria's cinema culture.\nBy the time another generation rose to build a new Nigerian movie industry from the ashes in the 1990s, it would be reborn as video films. \nThe new practitioners, in what would become known as Nollywood, were moving away from the practice and aesthetics of the likes of Ladebo, taking the audience with them. \nAs he told the BBC's Masterpiece programme in 2005, Ladebo admired the ingenuity of the early Nollywood marketers in cracking the problem of distribution, but he never cast his lot with the video film industry. \nCelluloid, he said, was \"cleaner and requires a different discipline.\" Heritage was shot in 16mm. No doubt, he was also cautious about access to his films because of the scourge of piracy in the Nigerian film distribution chain. \nAfter 1977, he stuck to making what he called advocacy films, usually in collaboration with funder organisations such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) and the UN Population Fund (UNPFA). \nHis 1992 production, Vendor, won four awards, including Best Director and Best Feature at the first Nigerian Film Festival in the same year. \nLadebo was among the very last of the visionary directors of Nigeria's early big-screen era, and was an important bridge between the different incarnations of the country's film industry - from celluloid to video and digital. \nHe is survived by his wife, Irene, three daughters and two grandchildren.

In some places the streets were blocked by rubble. Bulldozer operators were working overtime. Nothing they found was surprising. What has happened has been covered exhaustively on TV. But human beings like to see for themselves. \nIn Khan Younis, one of Gaza's towns, I went to the funeral of nine fighters who were killed in part of the tunnel network that Israel has targeted. \nIsraeli politicians and commanders have claimed that they have done serious damage to what they describe as an infrastructure of terror, run by Hamas and the smaller factions in Gaza. The damage to buildings is obvious. I have not been able to see underground military installations, but the talk here is that Hamas was shocked that Israel was able to kill its men when they believed they were safe underground. \nMorale among supporters of the armed groups in Gaza is another matter. It seems intact, even enhanced by the 11-day war. \nKhan Younis stopped for the funerals. Several thousand men prayed on a sports field and followed the stretchers carrying bodies wrapped in Palestinian flags, chanting their support on the way to the cemetery. \nIsrael and Hamas both claimed victory. \nIsraeli leaders listed buildings destroyed, Hamas commanders and fighters targeted and killed, and the remarkable success of the Iron Dome anti-missile system. \nHamas defines victory first of all as survival. Its leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, emerged triumphantly from hiding the day after the ceasefire. But Hamas will also look at the political scorecard with some satisfaction. \nHamas slogans have been chanted after prayers 60 miles (96km) inland from Gaza, at the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem. Hamas has driven home a message to Palestinians that it is prepared to fight and accept sacrifices for their rights in Jerusalem. Israel insists that all of Jerusalem is its eternal and indivisible capital. Palestinians have other ideas. \nThe Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is recognised internationally as the representative voice of his people through his leadership of the PLO and the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the occupied territories and was intended in the now moribund Oslo agreements of the 1990s to develop into the government of an independent state. \nBut Palestinians are deeply dissatisfied with the president's performance. He cancelled elections due for May that he looked likely to lose. Palestinians have not been able to vote for a president or a legislature since 2006. \nIn contrast, a simple message from Hamas that it would fight to the death for Jerusalem resonated with Palestinians who despair at the inability of President Abbas to slow down, let alone stop, the steady increase of Jewish settlement, illegal under international law, on occupied land they want for a state.\nIn Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will now return to the battle for political survival he was fighting before the 11 days of conflict with Hamas. \nMr Netanyahu is on trial on charges so serious that he could end up in jail for corruption, like his predecessor Ehud Olmert. On 10 May, the day Hamas dramatically escalated the conflict by firing missiles at Jerusalem, the prime minister was close to losing his job. \nHe has been a caretaker since the fourth inconclusive election in two years. In a month of trying, Mr Netanyahu failed to form a coalition that commanded the necessary 61 votes in parliament for a majority. \nHis main opponent, Yair Lapid, was taking his turn and looked to be days, even hours, away from announcing he had the votes to form a government. Mr Lapid's plans fell apart during the fighting. He still has time to rebuild them, though a fifth election might be a more likely outcome. \nIsrael also has to deal with the collapse of co-existence between its Jewish majority and Palestinian Arab minority, which makes up around 20 per cent of the population. Mr Netanyahu's polarising rhetoric and embrace of extreme Jewish nationalists have made a bad situation worse. \nLike the previous rounds of fighting between Israel and Hamas, the ceasefire is just a pause. The conflict is not just unresolved. It is not even frozen. The ceasefire will hold until it is tested by a crisis. That could be a rocket fired out of Gaza, or more Israeli police violence towards Palestinians in Jerusalem. \nOr it could be the lawsuit brought by Jewish settler groups to evict Palestinians from their homes in Sheikh Jarrah, a leafy district on the occupied eastern side of Jerusalem. The prospect of evicted Palestinian families being replaced by more Jewish settlers was a major reason why tension in Jerusalem turned violent. \nThe judgement in the case was postponed in a belated attempt to calm matters. But the case was not dropped, and the judgement will eventually be issued. Israel's legal timetable could deliver the ceasefire's first big challenge. "},

The country's state media said they would be accommodated in schools and places of worship. \nMount Nyiragongo is one of the world's more active volcanoes but there were concerns that its activity had not been properly observed by the Goma Volcano Observatory, since the World Bank cut funding amid allegations of corruption. \nProfessor Mike Burton, a volcanologist at the University of Manchester in England, told the BBC the lava in Mount Nyiragongo is particularly fluid and has the potential to move fast. \nIn a report on 10 May, the observatory warned that seismic activity at Nyiragongo had increased.\nLast year, the observatory's director, \n increasing the chances of an eruption in the next few years.

It said the plane and its passengers was searched, then Mr Protasevich was taken away.\nBelta, the state-owned news agency in Belarus, \n following the bomb alert, and approved despatching the MiG-29 fighter jet.\nIt has been angry and it is growing.\nThe US ambassador to Belarus, Julie Fisher, tweeted that it was \"abhorrent\" Mr Lukashenko had faked a bomb threat and sent fighter jets to arrest a journalist.\nEuropean Council chairman Charles Michel said EU leaders would discuss \"this unprecedented incident\" on Monday at a Council summit and it would not \"remain without consequences\".\nNato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said this was a \"serious and dangerous incident\".\nBoth Latvia and Lithuania said the airspace over Belarus should be recognised as unsafe, with Latvia's Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics saying it should be closed to all international flights.\nThe UN's agency for civil aviation, ICAO, said it was concerned about an \"apparent forced landing\" which could be \"in contravention of the Chicago Convention\" which sets out the rules on airspace and aircraft safety.\nPoland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said: \"Hijacking a civilian plane is an unprecedented act of state terrorism that cannot go unpunished.\"\nWe do not yet know the full details of this story but its implications could be huge.\nThere are questions about freedom of the air: how vulnerable may other flights be to this kind of behaviour? Some are already calling it an act of aggression or state terrorism, a form of hijacking. In how much danger were the passengers placed? What precedent may be set? Should flights be diverted away from Belarus airspace?\nThere are questions for international law: to what extent was this act unlawful, as many presume, and if so, what consequences should there be? There are questions about freedom of speech: will critics of other authoritarian regimes fear this could happen to them?\nAnd there are questions for international diplomacy. Political figures across Europe have already called for the EU and Nato to intervene. There are demands for further sanctions to be imposed on the government of Belarus, whose legitimacy is questioned by many in the West after disputed elections last year. President Lukashenko is often described as Europe's last dictator. Will the word \"pirate\" now be added to his list of titles? \nNexta is a media operation with a Telegram channel, and has visibility on Twitter and YouTube.\nIt played a key role for the Belarus opposition during the election and has continued to so in its aftermath, particularly with the government imposing news blackouts.\nMs Tikhanovskaya said Mr Protasevich, 26, had left Belarus in 2019 and covered the events of the 2020 presidential election with Nexta, after which criminal charges were filed against him in Belarus.\nShe said he faced the death penalty in Belarus as he has been categorised as a terrorist.\nWestern leaders have backed Ms Tikhanovskaya, who claimed victory in the election before she was forced to leave for Lithuania. She had become a candidate after her husband was jailed and barred from running.\nTens of thousands of protesters thronged the capital Minsk for months last year, furious at Mr Lukashenko's declaration of victory. There have been numerous cases of police brutality and some 2,700 prosecutions this year alone."},
