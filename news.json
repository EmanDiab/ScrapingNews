In 2019, there were almost 400,000 foreign visitors.\nFollowing a collapse in numbers during the pandemic, tourism is on the increase again.\nOn 25 March, Seychelles announced that visitors could enter without the need to quarantine, although a negative Covid test is still needed and entry restrictions apply for some countries.\nMore than 14,000 visitors arrived in April, far more than in March. But the government has rejected suggestions that this could have led to a rise in cases.\n\"There is also no evidence that tourists are bringing new infections into Seychelles,\" said Dr Gedeon."},

{"article_text": "His death in London came nearly 20 years after his last directorial effort, Heritage. The film had its UK premiere at the Khalili Theatre of the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas) in 2004. \nCentred on the trade in African artefacts fuelled by the international art market, the film feels prescient in light of the current debate about the restitution of African art treasures from museums of the West. \nLadebo felt strongly about the issue, comparing looted African art to someone stealing the Statue of Liberty. \nHe argued that the loss of artefacts had an adverse impact on societal cohesion, as the objects were made for cultural purposes and their absence could only be detrimental, due to the removal of vital information pertaining to a people's journey. \nHe did not spare the Nigerian elite in what he called the \"social crisis\" of art theft, pointing to acts of complicity in the illicit trade. \nHe was similarly unimpressed by African governments, which he accused of lacking seriousness about arts and culture, decrying their failure to accord museums their proper place in the education system. \nLadebo believed a realistic outcome for Nigeria would be part-return or part-purchase arrangements with Western museums. He further suggested periodical travelling exhibitions that would allow people to see the artefacts in their homeland. \nBut the ground has since shifted significantly. The debate over the Benin Bronzes has reached unprecedented levels, and developments are unfolding which might have seemed unthinkable a couple of years ago. \nGermany is to return looted Benin Bronzes to Nigeria; so is the University of Aberdeen as well as several institutions, especially museums, from the UK to Europe and America. \nIn the current atmosphere, it is reasonable to think that Ladebo, too, would be much more strident today in his reckoning of an issue that preoccupied him so much he made a film about it, pumping much of his family savings into the project. \nThe director and producer had hoped to work with Swiss backers to make a series of documentaries titled, Who Owns Art and Culture? However, it does not appear anything came of the arrangement. \nHeritage suffered the fate of much of his filmography - made with passion and idealism but seen by few. \nBorn Raymond Oladipupo Ladebo in the city of Ijebu-Ode in Nigeria's Ogun State, the director obtained business and marketing degrees from US universities, and worked as a media analyst and accounts executive before going into films in collaboration with African-American actor Ossie Davis, who described Ladebo as a son-in-law. \nTheir greatest collaboration was on the film Countdown At Kusini (1976), co-written by Ladebo and directed by Davis, who also starred in the film alongside Ruby Dee. \nCountdown At Kusini was the first of its kind in many ways, and its unique place in the history of black cinema is now an acknowledged fact. \n\"The first film to be made by Black Americans and Africans working together on African soil, Kusini gives us a rare glimpse of the modern reality of Africa. All film was done in and around Lagos, Nigeria,\" noted the US newspaper, Ann Arbor Sun, in 1976. \nA conscious Pan-African production conceived to counter stereotypical portrayals of African Americans particularly in the Blaxploitation films of the early 1970s, Kusini was the first film ever to be funded by a black women's organisation, the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, in a case of crowdfunding and media activism that was ahead of its time. \nBut for all the good intentions, Kusini's backers had not banked on non-committal Hollywood distributors and theatres, as the film was pulled summarily from the cinema by Columbia Pictures. \nWhen Kusini was shown at the Diaspora Festival of Black and Independent Film in the US in 2018, it was its first screening in 30 years. \nMany older Nigerians fondly remember Ladebo's iconic film, Bisi - Daughter of the River (1977), a vehicle for British-Nigerian actress, Patti Boulaye, in the high point of Nigerian cinema.\nThe economic downturn and Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) of the 1980s led to a steep decline in Nigeria's cinema culture.\nBy the time another generation rose to build a new Nigerian movie industry from the ashes in the 1990s, it would be reborn as video films. \nThe new practitioners, in what would become known as Nollywood, were moving away from the practice and aesthetics of the likes of Ladebo, taking the audience with them. \nAs he told the BBC's Masterpiece programme in 2005, Ladebo admired the ingenuity of the early Nollywood marketers in cracking the problem of distribution, but he never cast his lot with the video film industry. \nCelluloid, he said, was \"cleaner and requires a different discipline.\" Heritage was shot in 16mm. No doubt, he was also cautious about access to his films because of the scourge of piracy in the Nigerian film distribution chain. \nAfter 1977, he stuck to making what he called advocacy films, usually in collaboration with funder organisations such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) and the UN Population Fund (UNPFA). \nHis 1992 production, Vendor, won four awards, including Best Director and Best Feature at the first Nigerian Film Festival in the same year. \nLadebo was among the very last of the visionary directors of Nigeria's early big-screen era, and was an important bridge between the different incarnations of the country's film industry - from celluloid to video and digital. \nHe is survived by his wife, Irene, three daughters and two grandchildren.

{"article_text": "\"Miss? What's that?\" said a nine-year-old boy, pointing towards the waves, as they walked along Blackpool promenade.\nIt turned out he'd never seen the sea before.\nA surprise, given the school is in the middle of Blackpool and only a few streets from the seafront.\nOther teachers have had similar experiences over the years on school trips outside the city, she explains. A 10-year-old once asked what a duck was, while a pupil - spotting cows in the field - said: \"Look at those horses.\"\n\"As a school, we're in a very built-up area in Blackpool,\" Kim explains. \"We've had some very extreme examples of our children with nature.\"\nWestminster Primary Academy is in an area with few green spaces where wildlife and nature are in short supply. \nAlthough many children live only minutes from the beach, they may not get to spend much time there. And while Blackpool is surrounded by spectacular countryside, such as the Forest of Bowland, Kim says many parents don't have cars or can't afford public transport.\n\"They're just not getting the opportunities a lot of other children would get,\" she adds. \"So, we thought, 'well, let's bring nature to them'.\"\nKim is now outdoor education lead at the primary school, which became a Nature Friendly School two years ago. The scheme, which aims to make school grounds greener and wilder, is a partnership between The Wildlife Trusts, mental health charity YoungMinds, and several other nature organisations.\nThe project trains teachers to deliver outdoor classes, inspiring their pupils to learn more about environmental challenges and the natural world, and encouraging teamwork, social skills, confidence and creativity.\nNature Friendly Schools has already worked with 90 schools in areas with high levels of social deprivation, giving thousands of pupils the opportunity to learn and play in nature.\nThe leaders hope to expand the programme this year to help children find solace in nature after the hardships of lockdowns.\nThe Wildlife Trusts chief executive Craig Bennett says spending time outside, engaging with and learning about nature, is paramount to children's education. \n\"Sadly, so many children go to school in areas where there is very little access to green space,\" he says.  \n\"At The Wildlife Trusts, we want to break down barriers that inhibit children from spending time in nature - including during the school day.\"\nWestminster Academy now has an outdoor classroom as well as a pond, more trees and wildflowers, a trim-trail and an outdoor gym. \nThe teachers incorporate nature into the curriculum as much as they can, says Kim. \"What we're trying to do as a school is to get our children to like, respect and admire nature, so that - as they grow up - they understand the significance and importance of keeping it safe and keeping our planet safe.\"\nIn lessons outside, children learn about threats to bees, including climate change, habitat loss and pesticides. \nPond dipping is a perennial favourite, not just to identify water creatures, but to learn about physical forces through studying floating objects.\n\"The children absolutely love it,\" she says. \"A lot of them say it doesn't feel like learning even though we know we're learning and that's what makes it so good for them.\"\nWhen Kim asked her young charges to say what they liked about outdoor learning, the responses were heart-warming. \n\"One girl said, 'I just love discovering new creatures.' Another explained, 'When I'm outside, it doesn't feel like learning, because it's so much fun and I just know that my brain is getting bigger'.\" \nFollow \n on Twitter."},
{"article_text": "If Glastonbury's evocative, enthralling live-stream concert is anything to go by, the answer is a resounding \"yes\".\nWhether it was Coldplay playing in the driving rain, or Haim framed by a spectacular sunset - the five-hour film was a bittersweet love letter to the magic of music festivals.\nOr at least it was, once we actually got to see it. Within minutes of the all-star, pay-per-view show starting on Saturday night, things went badly wrong.\nThousands of ticketholders received errors saying \"invalid code\" or \"access denied\". Pretty soon, fans supplanted the official hashtag #LiveAtWorthyFarm with the altogether more accurate #NotLiveAtWorthyFarm.\nIt took two hours to sort the technical problems out, by which point many viewers had given up and gone to watch the UK \n Again. \nEventually, organisers abandoned the ticketing system altogether and made the concert free for anyone to watch. You could rewind the stream a little - but poor old Wolf Alice and Michel Kiwanuka, who kicked off the event, were lost down the back of the internet sofa.\nI entered half-way through a blistering set from Bristol punk band Idles, and was instantly thrust into the sweaty atmosphere of a subterranean club gig, as a free-roaming camera captured the jostling aggro of a mosh-pit.\nLike many bands on the bill, they played in a tight circular formation, making up for the lack of an audience by performing to each other. It was a minor (but smart) modification that stopped the sets feeling staged and sterile. \nHaim were up next, bringing some LA cool to proceedings, as they ran through the laid-back grooves of their latest album, Women In Music, Pt III.\nSongs like Summer Girl and The Steps were custom built for outdoor venues, and the band were clearly relishing the chance to give them an airing from inside Glastonbury's legendary Stone Circle.\n\"This is our favourite festival in the whole entire world,\" said singer Danielle Haim, who was otherwise a frontwoman of very few words. \nColdplay took up their rightful position in front of (the frame of) the Pyramid Stage just after 21:00 BST, illuminating the fields with a spectacular light and laser show.\nFour-time headliners, their set list was typically faultless, cramming in Fix You, The Scientist, Viva La Vida, Clocks and A Sky Full Of Stars into a 30-minute slot - as well as a delicate new song, Human Heart, performed with US R&B singers We Are King.\n\"This is very weird but very fun,\" said Martin, pointing out he was essentially playing to \"thousands and thousands of cows\".\nHe jokingly played in some canned applause, but there was no hiding the fact no-one was watching. There were none of Glastonbury's traditional flags, no flares, no mud, no cups trampled into the ground, and no chemically-altered maniacs trying to make you dance with them... \nOnly one thing remained consistent: Coldplay were absolutely drenched in rain.\n\"If there's a day you didn't want to stand in a field, it's today,\" laughed Martin. \nEven so, the sight of the festival's favourite band playing alone was strangely melancholy. Take it from someone who knows, gingerly singing The Scientist to your 10-year-old's favourite teddy will never be the same as belting it out in a field of happy strangers. \nDon't get me wrong, though. The teddy loved it.\nColdplay were the de facto headliners, taking the time slot when (if all had gone to plan) most people were likely to tune in. After they cleared the stage, things became a little more sedate.\nDamon Albarn turned up in a mullet to play a set almost entirely devoid of Blur songs -  thanks a lot, Damon - while debuting music from his forthcoming project The Nearer the Fountain, More Pure the Stream Flows, which is \"inspired by the landscapes of Iceland\".\nAt a normal festival, this was the point where you'd have wandered off to see who was playing the jazz stage or to queue up for a doughnut, but the live-stream meant we were all hostage to Damon's wistful meanderings. I certainly didn't switch over to watch the Eurovision voting for a couple of minutes, and anyone who says otherwise is a liar, OK?\nJorja Smith brought the mood back up, exuding a breezy mellowness on songs like Blue Lights and Be Honest; after which Radiohead's Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood debuted their new side-project The Smile.\nInitially, they sounded quite a lot like Radiohead - in fact, the first track was an unreleased Radiohead track called Skirting On The Surface - but as their eight-song set wore on, things got pleasantly weirder, drawing on punk and math rock and spiralling jazz riffs. \nAnd while most latter-day Radiohead material has been a slow burn, Yorke's new melodies (and Greenwood's restless basslines) had a compelling immediacy. A debut album can't be far off.\nBack outside, Kano brought some much-needed eccentricity, playing his grime anthem Rude Boy with a marching band on a Billie Jean dancefloor. \nHe maintained a ferocious energy for the next 30 minutes, powering through apocalyptic versions of Teardrops and Free Years Later before emerging into the light with the funky set-closers Can't Hold We Down and SYM.\nA much-needed shot of adrenaline, it perfectly set up the final act - an after-hours DJ set by Honey Dijon, filmed on a customised bus in the festival's Block9 area.\nAs she dropped tunes by Diana Ross and Lady Gaga, a small crew of socially-distanced dancers strutted around outside the bus, a sight that instantly transported me to the dying moments of Glastonbury 2019. \nBack then, while queuing up to leave the site, I watched three spaced out festival-goers desperately fanning the embers of their weekend by throwing shapes to a burger van's portable radio, insisting the owner was the \"best DJ we've heard all weekend, mate\".\nAs Jarvis Cocker said in one of tonight's spoken-word interludes, that's exactly what makes Glastonbury great.\n\"All those extra-curricular activities you just discover while wandering around, they're often the best bits of the weekend.\"\nIt made me nostalgic for the festival all over again; and even more determined to make the pilgrimage if it comes back, as planned, next year. \n\"We are going to throw everything at 2022,\" organiser Emily Eavis told the BBC earlier this week. \"The light is coming in. \n\"We're able to move out of this very awkward time and plan to be back in fields again; and to be watching live music; and camping for five days outside with 200,000 other people.\"\nAnd if, in the meantime, someone doesn't start a band called \"Invalid Code\" and get themselves onto the bill, something will have gone terribly wrong."},

Only 1,054 of those cases were of the Indian variant, known as B.1.617.2.\nDr Jenny Harries told the Andrew Marr Show the study was \"very good news\". \nThe chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency said the study is the \"first real-world evidence of vaccine effectiveness\" against the variant.\nAsked about the discrepancy between the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccine results, she said a key factor to consider was that the \"different vaccines were given to slightly different groups of people\". \n\"The Pfizer vaccine was rolled out initially, because it had to be kept at ultra-low temperatures, to - for example - healthcare workers, who tended to be younger,\" she said. \n\"This is an all-age study. Whereas AstraZeneca went out to older groups of individuals who were unable to come into main centres.\"   \nAs the virus changes, protection against infection was always going to be the first thing that slips.\nSo the fact that the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines offer such a high degree of protection against the Indian variant after the second dose is very reassuring given experts expect it to become dominant.\nBut what are the implications of the drop in effectiveness of the first dose where the Indian variant is concerned?\nGiven it's expected to become the dominant variant in the UK, it's now even more important people get their second jab.\nThe more difficult question to answer is what this means for the speed of the route back to normality.\nIts ability to evade the vaccines even by a small degree will be a factor in how more transmissible this variant is here.\nThere are also other biological reasons why it might find it easier to spread.\nBut this does not necessarily mean we will see a surge in cases and, crucially, hospital admissions - the protection vaccines give us against serious illness will be much much higher than their ability to block mild infections.\nThe Indian variant certainly gives the virus a bit more of an advantage, but it doesn't mean the vaccines won't win out.\nThe study looked at data from all age groups from 5 April, to cover the period since the Indian variant emerged.\nThere is not enough data to estimate how effective the vaccine is against severe outcomes for the Indian variant, PHE said.\nDr Jamie Lopez Bernal, consultant medical epidemiologist at PHE and the study's lead author, said there was higher confidence in the data from the first vaccine dose than that from the second as \"there are bigger numbers that have been vaccinated with one dose\".\nProf Susan Hopkins, PHE's Covid-19 strategic response director, said the data trend was \"quite clear\" and was heading in the \"right direction\".\nMeanwhile, Gordon Brown has urged Prime Minister Boris Johnson to use next month's G7 summit in Cornwall to step up funding of the global Covid vaccine rollout. \nIn an interview for BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, the former prime minister said what rich countries had given so far would not meet the needs of this year and next year. \n and 22m have had their second.\nSome 13,000 deaths and 39,100 hospitalisations have been prevented in the UK due to the vaccination programme up to 9 May, according to PHE analysis."},

Following the rise in cases, India's 29 states have been told to declare the disease an epidemic.\nNewly opened wards to treat patients suffering from the disease around the country are filling up fast, doctors say.\nAt the 1,100-bed state-run Maharaja Yeshwantrao Hospital in the central Indian city of Indore, the number of patients had leapt from eight a week ago, to 185 on Saturday evening.\nMore than 80% of the patients need surgery immediately, Dr VP Pandey, head of the hospital's department of medicine, told the BBC.\nDr Pandey said the hospital had set up 11 wards with a total of 200 beds to treat black fungus patients: \"This surge in patients was definitely unexpected,\" he said. \"We used to see one or two cases a year previously.\"\nHe reckoned that there were at least 400 patients with the disease in Indore alone.\n\"The black fungus infection has now become more challenging than Covid-19. If patients are not treated in time and properly, than the mortality rate can go up to 94%. The cost of treatment is expensive, and the drugs are in [short supply],\" Dr Pandey said.\nDoctors say amphotericin B or \"ampho-B\" is an anti-fungal intravenous injection which has to be administered every day for up to eight weeks to patients diagnosed with mucormycosis. There are two forms of the drug available: standard amphotericin B deoxycholate and liposomal amphotericin.\nDr Pandey said he had collected data concerning 201 patients from four hospitals in the city. \nThe majority of the patients had recovered from Covid-19 and were male. Most of them had been treated with steroids, and all had underlying conditions, mainly diabetes.\nA separate study by four Indian doctors has looked at more than 100 cases of Covid-19 patients who had contracted mucormycosis. It found 79 of them were men, and 83 of them suffered from diabetes.\nAnother study of 45 black fungus patients in two Mumbai hospitals found that all were diabetics or diagnosed with diabetes on admission. They all had very steep blood sugar levels. \n\"No patient of mucormycosis has normal blood sugar,\" Dr Akshay Nayar, an eye surgeon who has treated a number of patients, told the BBC.\nMucormycosis is a very rare infection. It is caused by exposure to mucor mould which is commonly found in soil, plants, manure, and decaying fruits and vegetables. \"It is ubiquitous and found in soil and air and even in the nose and mucus of healthy people,\" says Dr Akshay Nair, a Mumbai-based eye surgeon.\nIt affects the sinuses, the brain and the lungs, and can be life-threatening in diabetic or severely immuno-compromised individuals, such as cancer patients or people with HIV/Aids."},

We express deep condolences and sympathy to the families of the victims and the injured.\""},

{"article_text": "Lava from the volcano lit up clouds over the eastern city, which has a population of two million.\nPeople tried to douse the flames as the lava flowed, engulfing parts of the city and roads.\nLava could be seen between buildings in the city.\nCity residents fled with mattresses and other belongings.\nAfter reaching some of the city's suburbs and the airport to the east, the flow of lava is now said to have stopped. \nThousands of Congolese, including children, women and old people, have sought refuge in neighbouring Rwanda as the volcano erupted.  \nHere they sleep with their belongings on a street in the town of Gisenyi on the border with DR Congo.\nMount Nyiragongo is one of the world's more active volcanoes - seen here from Tchegera Island on Lake Kivu outside Goma."},
{"article_text": "As the sky turned red and rivers of lava streamed from Mount Nyiragongo, there were concerns that its past deadly tragedies would be repeated. \nA mass evacuation was launched in the city of Goma, which has a population of about two million people. \nHowever, the city was largely spared and some residents are now returning.\nThe volcano, located 10km (six miles) from Goma, last erupted in 2002, killing 250 people and making 120,000 homeless.\nThere has been no official report of casualties during the latest eruption and it is unclear how many homes have been damaged. \nOn Sunday morning, Communications Minister Patrick Muyay tweeted to say the intensity of the lava flow had slowed and an assessment of the humanitarian situation was ongoing.\nThe BBC's Emery Makumeno in DR Congo's capital Kinshasa said a greater quantity of the lava took the direction of the forest, flowing away from the city. \nOur reporter said it stopped short of the international airport, despite earlier reports to the contrary. However, it did set some houses on fire and crossed a graveyard.\nOne resident, Zacharie Paluku, told the Associated Press news agency that the eruption had sparked fear and people began running. \"We really don't know what to do,\" he said.\nSome locals complained about the lack of information from the authorities amid conflicting accounts circulating on social media.\nCrowds were seen with mattresses and other belongings, fleeing even before the government's announcement, which came several hours after the eruption started.\nMany residents headed across the nearby Rwandan border, while others went to higher ground to the west of the city. \nRwandan authorities said about 3,000 people had officially crossed from Goma. The country's state media said they would be accommodated in schools and places of worship. \nOne Goma resident, Richard Bahati, said he was in his house when he heard screaming. \"I got out and saw the sky was red. I am so worried, so worried. I lived through the problem with this volcano in 2002. The volcano devastated all our homes and possessions.\"\nElectricity was out across large areas in the aftermath of the eruption. \n\"There is a smell of sulphur. In the distance you can see giant flames coming out of the mountain,\" resident Carine Mbala told AFP news agency. \nMount Nyiragongo is one of the world's more active volcanoes but there were concerns that its activity had not been properly observed by the Goma Volcano Observatory, since the World Bank cut funding amid allegations of corruption. \nIn a report on 10 May, the observatory warned that seismic activity at Nyiragongo had increased.\nLast year, the observatory's director, \n increasing the chances of an eruption in the next few years. But he also warned that an earthquake could trigger a disaster earlier.\nThe volcano's deadliest eruption happened in 1977, when more than 600 people died."},
