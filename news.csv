"Around 260 miles away in Plymouth, another submarine made its debut that same day. A minnow compared to HMS Anson, this secretive nine-tonne craft may have greater implications for the future of the navy than the £1.3bn nuclear boat. 
MSubs of Plymouth, a specialist in autonomous underwater vehicles, won a £2.5m Ministry of Defence contract to build and test an Extra-Large Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (XLUUV) that should be able to operate up to 3,000 miles from home for three months. 
The big innovation here is the autonomy. The submarine's movements and actions will be governed entirely by Artificial Intelligence (AI). 
Ollie Thompson is a recent graduate who is studying for a master's degree in robotics at Plymouth University. He also works for MarineAI, the MSubs arm that is fitting out the XLUUV's brain. 
Mr Thompson has no doubts about the challenge he and his colleagues face: ""We know a lot of people don't have confidence in AI. So we work with elements we can test, we separate things into boxes.""
He divides the AI problem into components - and mission management is the toughest. This attempts to simulate the presence of a trained captain in the little submarine's programming. 
This is AI working in total isolation from human contact, not least because maintaining strict radio silence is critical to a submarine's covert role. The technical principle here is machine learning, showing an AI program examples of how a task should be performed until it has embedded the right actions in its own repertoire. 
To do this, MarineAI is using a huge IBM AC922 supercomputer, ""a monster, one of the biggest in the South-West of England"" Mr Thompson boasts. In contrast the on-board brain of the submarine resides in a 15cm square box and relies on an Nvidia chip often found driving computer games.
""We built it off the back of the Nvidia chip because it's highly energy efficient,"" says Mr Thompson. Just like a tiny but powerful Raspberry Pi device used to teach schoolchildren basic programming tasks this approach takes up very little power. And keeping power consumption to the bare minimum is critical to making the submarine's battery last. 
It's clear that the Ministry of Defence is paying very close attention to battery technology for this project. So far MarineAI is relying on existing technology derived from car batteries. But it notes that research in this field is leaping forward. 
The AI content of the computer should prioritise tasks. The project envisages a boat that can travel to an area of the sea-bed to search for mines or plant a sophisticated electronic intelligence-gathering package or stay in place and scour its environment for information on a hostile navy. 
So MarineAI is creating a decision-making capacity for the submarine's brain. It will know how much battery life is left and how to weigh that against prevailing weather conditions and sea states, reaching a logical decision on whether to sail on or return home in the face of strong tides. 
The project has oceans left to cross. For instance, how can the submarine detect small objects on the surface such as jet-skis?  
All of these dilemmas are small beer for human submarine captains. Commander Ryan Ramsey captained the hunter-killer HMS Turbulent and taught on the Perisher, a five-month-long course the navy uses to push prospective submarine skippers to the limit.  
This decides if they are fit to command 100 or more submariners working punishing watches consisting of six hours on, six hours off for the duration of a long patrol. 
Cdr Ramsey worked in AI after leaving the navy and can see where smart software and human instinct might not produce the same response.
""AI will struggle to match human decision-making skills. There are lots of submariners skills you can transfer to it, but you have to accept that the first generation will not be perfect."" 
He cites how he would study opposing Nato submarine commanders he went up against in exercises, learning how far each individual was prepared to push a vessel. ""The reality is that if you don't know how a guy operates he will find your submarine before you find him. You can't replicate that emotional input in AI."" 
If the XLUUV is ever to be armed that might create serious problems. The decision to fire a torpedo rests on a huge reserve of each officer's instincts and experience. ""If you leave that to a rules-based system you might escalate things. There is just so much to learn about the underwater battlespace.""
In the future Cdr Ramsey believes submarines will be equipped with the ability to launch their own autonomous vessels. The next generation of surface warships entering service are already planned to feature mission-bays for launching uncrewed vessels. And autonomous submarines can be deployed by transport aircraft, giving the batteries a rest and the XLUUV a global reach. 
The longer-term prospect for AI-controlled submarines is rosy, says Cdr Ramsey. ""I can see a way to do a Perisher for AI. Get the right people to recreate their experiences in a simulator and let the AI learn from that, including human decisions that might be wrong. Give it ten years' worth of data and it will be able to build its own rules."" 
This simulator-based course for computer code promises another big benefit. ""The AI can test out its own rules without any risk. My worry with autonomous submarines is the political impact if the vessel does something wrong or gets caught in hostile waters,"" he says.   
Plymouth's trial submarine is based on an MSubs design known as the S201. And across the Atlantic, Boeing is building a series of large uncrewed submersibles as the US Navy works out how these vessels can be used. 
Former submariners talk about the degree of teamwork and close comradeship required to perform their missions. AI cannot replicate this, but it does not need to if all it is doing is saving sailors from exhausting and repetitive tasks better allocated to a drone. 
The Royal Navy is coy about its plans for this technology and is committed to a next generation of crewed nuclear submarines. Yet the work of Plymouth's AI pioneers may see their most perilous missions delegated to an AI program that never goes off watch.

"Striking images have captured the human cost of the conflict over the past few days, as air strikes and rocket attacks turn homes and possessions into rubble and force people to rush for shelter.
Israel says its air strikes on Gaza have targeted Palestinian militants but power lines and main roads have also been damaged.
In the image above, a Palestinian man hunches over the rubble of his destroyed home following an Israeli strike on Sunday. 
Some of his family were buried beneath the debris.
That day was the deadliest in Gaza since fighting erupted more than a week ago.
Israeli air strikes hit a busy street just after midnight, causing several buildings to collapse and dozens of deaths.
""We need at least 10 years more to build what has been damaged here in Gaza,"" Mohammad Abu Rayya, a paediatrician, told the BBC on Monday following further strikes.
Impromptu funerals have been held around the territory. The woman above is mourning her family who died in a strike in Gaza City.
Meanwhile Hamas, which controls Gaza, and other Palestinian militant groups there, have continued to launch rockets towards southern Israel.
Homes and buildings have been damaged, and millions of Israelis have been forced to flee to safe rooms or shelters as warning sirens blare. 
The young girl above was pictured at a bomb shelter in the city of Ashkelon, which has borne the brunt of the rocket attacks.
Victoria Tapalashvili can be seen inspecting the damage at her home in the southern Israeli city of Ashdod following an attack.
""It is not easy - almost every evening, every night, we get the kids out of bed [and] run to shelters,"" Israeli tech executive and father of three, Eitan Singer, told the BBC.
""We have 30 seconds to 60 seconds to find a shelter.""
This image shows another damaged home in Ashdod. 
Israel's Iron Dome defence system is said to have intercepted 90% of the rockets fired at its territory.
Rockets have also been fired from neighbouring Lebanon towards northern Israel.
The violence also spread to the occupied West Bank, where Israeli troops clashed with Palestinians over the weekend.
These Palestinians watch from a window as mourners carry the body of a relative during a funeral in the West Bank on Sunday.

This man, Riyad Eshkuntana, was pulled from the rubble along with his six-year-old daughter, Suzy, in Gaza.
She was trapped for hours underneath their home, and was eventually reunited with her father at Gaza's largest hospital.
""Forgive me, my daughter. You screamed to me to come to you, but I couldn't come,"" Mr Eshkuntana told her when they were reunited, according to Reuters.

""I wanted to show them as they are and at the same time to empower them."" 
While photographing each girl, Mendelsohn asked them about their ambitions, dislikes and hopes for the future.
She soon realised that their responses provided snapshots of wider issues in the world at the time.
""Initially, many of the girls talked about their fear and worries of war, homelessness and self-image,"" she says.
""As the years went on, they started to talk about fear for the planet and climate change.
""The last girl I photographed talked about her fear of coronavirus, around seven weeks before the first lockdown.

A lifelong advocate for the Amazon's indigenous people, Salgado documented the daily lives of a dozen of the tribes scattered throughout the rainforest - from hunting and fishing expeditions, to dances and rituals.
Born in 1944, Salgado left a career in economics to start as a photographer in 1973.
He worked on international assignments for a variety of photography agencies before forming his own, Amazonas Images, with his wife, Lélia, in 1994. 
Over the years, Salgado's work has featured in numerous exhibitions and books, the latest of which brings together his Amazon photography.

"More than 200,000 people were killed during the 36-year civil war between the military and left-wing rebels which ended in 1996. Of these, an estimated 45,000 people were forcibly disappeared, their bodies buried in unmarked pits or dumped in mass graves.
Over the years, the Forensic Anthropology Foundation of Guatemala (FAFG) has tried to locate and identify the remains of the victims of forced disappearances. 
They collect DNA samples from family members, carry out exhumations and return the identified remains of victims to their relatives for a dignified burial. 
But as the Covid-19 pandemic struck, the FAFG was forced to suspend its field visits for almost a year. 
In February, the FAFG resumed its work in the Ixil Mayan communities of Nebaj, Cotzal and Chajul. In 1982, some of the most brutal massacres of the armed conflict were carried out in this area under the orders of then-military ruler General Efrain Rios Montt.
Rios Montt was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013 but his conviction was later overturned. He died in 2018 while a retrial was under way. 
Even though Guatemala's Supreme Court of Justice ruled in 2018 that acts of genocide were carried out against the Ixil people, only a small number of low-ranking soldiers have been convicted of war crimes and Rios Montt has not been convicted of genocide posthumously. 
Meanwhile, for many in the communities ravaged by the conflict, the search for those forcibly disappeared decades ago continues. 
In 1982, Juliana Tum Sicá's family hid in the mountains near Xexuxcap along with several other people in order to safeguard their lives from constant attacks by the Guatemalan army. 
While hiding in the mountains, Juliana's daughter, Paula Ajanel Tum, became ill and, without access to food or medicines, died aged seven.
Her body was buried in a shallow clandestine grave. The family hopes to recover the girl's skeletal remains to provide a proper burial.
The executive director and founder of FAFG, Fredy Peccerelli, says that the passage of time and other obstacles, such as the pandemic, will not stop his group: ""Families still deserve to have someone accompany their search to try to identify their loved ones."" 
The FAFG has been working for years to locate, exhume and identify the remains of missing people. In September 2014, members of their team exhumed human remains at a former military garrison in Cotzal.
Through DNA testing they were able to identify them as those of Baltazar Gómez Toma. 
Toma and several other Ixil Mayan men had been summoned to the garrison on 3 February 1982. They were accused of being guerrilla sympathisers and executed by firing squad. 
After the FAFG identified his remains, they handed them over to his family for a proper burial in February 2021, after they had carried out the necessary Covid-19 safety protocols.
""It is our responsibility to continue to provide the experience and scientific know-how to accompany their brave search. They are not alone,"" Fredy Peccerelli says of his team's work.
The FAFG also carried out forensic analyses on the remains of José María Gran Cirera, Domingo del Barrio Batz and Tomás Ramírez Caba.
The three men were killed by the Guatemalan Army in 1980 after being accused of aiding guerrilla forces that operated in the region. José María Gran Cirera, who was originally from Spain, was the Catholic priest in the village of Chajul at the time and was killed along with his sacristan, Domingo del Barrio Batz in June 1980. 
Tomás Ramírez Caba, who also served as a sacristan in his parish, was killed at the entrance of Chajul's Catholic Church later that same year. All three have been decreed martyrs by Pope Francis.
Their bodies were originally laid to rest in a crypt inside Chajul's Catholic Church but have been reburied following a beatification ceremony. 
FAFG founder Freddy Peccerelli says that not only are the scars left by the armed conflict in communities like Chajul, Nebej  and Cotzal still very deep, they continue to have repercussions today. 
Poverty, lack of access to land, corruption and a increasing economic polarisation all play a role in keeping rural communities destitute.
""The conflict widened the gap in access to education and to opportunities for work and employment,"" he says. 
""The people who benefited and profited from the conflict now occupy political positions,"" Mr Peccerelli says. 
He thinks that until Guatemalans come to terms with their past and there are opportunities for them to build a better future within Guatemala, many will continue to emigrate to the United States. 
Meanwhile, FAFG forensic experts continue their work to reunite families like that of Francisco Toma to lay to rest the remains of their loved ones.
Soldiers in uniform abducted Francisco Toma from his home in February 1982. His family was never told where he had been taken or what had happened to him. 
His remains were among scores of bodies exhumed by the FAFG from a mass grave at the Xolosinay Military Garrison in 2014.

"There's an old line that goes ""you only get wrinkles where the smiles have been"".
Mine though are cropping up in some of the strangest corners of my 54-year-old face.
Applying a surgical remedy hadn't been on my radar until recently, when the past year exposed a possibly surprising rise in men seeking ""tweakment"".
The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons says that 
. Could it be because we have all spent the past year forever seeing our reflection on work video calls?
""We know that more and more people have been on social media, and conference calls, because they've been stuck at home,"" says Dr Helena Lewis-Smith, a psychology researcher specialising in body image at the University of the West of England.
""There's a tool on Zoom, for example, allowing people to smooth their skin's appearance. People who are more likely to press that button during these calls are more likely to be invested in their appearance, and have a worse body image.""
The growing trend of male cosmetic surgery is more pronounced in the US, 
.
""Our society places a premium on youthfulness,"" says Dr Alan Matarasso, a previous president of the American Association of Plastic Surgeons. ""Men are as concerned as anybody else about their appearance.
""And there's been a change in the culture of male preening - it's become socially acceptable for men, whereas before it might not have been so.""
The changing patterns of modern work also provides a more hard-nosed business logic, he thinks. 
""We're not in a world any more where somebody lives in the same house, or works in the same job, their whole lives,"" says Dr Matarasso. ""And whether you subscribe to this or not, many of us judge people on first impressions.""
I hadn't been pressing any image-altering buttons on video calls, but I was curious to see what the fuss was about. I had already discussed my plan with friends and family, whose responses ranged from smirks and alarm, to fascination, and in one case - ill-concealed envy.
Plastic surgery does start to feel like the front-line of an undeclared culture war, with prejudice and shaming liberally dispensed on both sides. 
For those taking the plunge, probably the most popular intervention (for men and women) is Botox. Also known as botulinum toxin, it's the trade name of a protein that in much larger volumes is active in the disease, botulism.
But don't let that necessarily put you off. Applied minimally to your face, it's billed as helping to smooth out wrinkles, such as crow's feet and frown lines, freezing muscles for a period of months at a time. 
""We have older successful businessmen, and the owner of a racing car company,"" says Dr Salinda Johnson, describing some of the clients who visit her London Cosmetic Clinic. ""Older men are more concerned about ageing. And we also have younger City workers who want to look more handsome and more attractive.""
After a brief consultation, I'm encouraged to lie back on her couch, receive a generous smear of anti-septic across my forehead, and then a series of pin-prick jabs. It's a very fine needle.
I didn't find the injections uncomfortable, although I was warned of possible short-term headaches, and to avoid vigorous exercise over the coming hours. But I'm still debating with myself whether my lines and creases aren't simply an indication of experience or character.
""There's only so much character we want to have!"" argues Dr Matarasso, who says that for many of his male patients, the experience can feel transformative. But he warns he's not in the business of providing eternal youth.
""We're here to make people look as good as they feel. We really can't turn back the clock on a 65-year-old and make them look like they're 25.""
Social and the mainstream media are awash with salutary tales about plastic surgery gone wrong. There are no shortage of highly-reputable clinicians offering treatment, but there's also an army of untrained practitioners, particularly in less-regulated countries, drawn by the huge profits to be made in this industry.
 is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast.
While the risks associated with a Botox injection are low, anyone planning treatment is urged to check thoroughly the qualifications of those providing it, as well as the options for aftercare. 
""TV shows and social media are essentially normalising what can be very risky procedures,"" warns Dr Lewis-Smith. ""People do experience some degree of increased happiness and body satisfaction [from cosmetic surgery] short-term, but we don't know how they're going to feel five or 10 years down the line.""
She is concerned about the trend among both men and women to place so much effort into perfecting themselves, especially when fashions around appearance and body shape are prone to change.
""Now it's all about the Kardashians, 10 years ago it was Kate Moss,"" she says. ""Think about those people's different body types. Women might now want to have buttock implants, breast implants, lip fillers, but what happens after a few years when we're sold a different ideal?""
Two weeks after my Botox injections I don't see any big changes in my own appearance, although I do have a general numbness in my forehead. The muscle-freezing will help to inhibit the creation of future wrinkles, I'm told.
Botox is actually more preventative than transformative, and will require another round after three or four months if I'm determined to maintain the effect. This is said to be how many of Hollywood's leading men have held on to their youthful skin for longer than you'd imagine. Although some, like George Clooney, claim not to be tempted. 
The global market 
  For Dr Lewis-Smith the concern is where this relentless pursuit of cosmetic improvement is leading us. 
""We're trying to adapt what we're born with for the beauty industry to make money,"" she says. ""So it does make me scared to be honest.
""We are giving them our money because we want to feel better about ourselves, and to match those ideals with what they show us. They're trading on and exploiting people's dissatisfaction.""

"He oversees a team of 21 analysts in Cambridge who locate, identify and remove child sexual abuse material (CSAM) from the internet. 
The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) is funded by the global tech industry.
It manually reviews online reports of suspected criminal content sent in by the public. Mr Hughes sees upsetting material every day.
When content is verified, analysts create unique ""digital fingerprints"" of each photo or video, then send it to law enforcement and tech firms. They also search for material online.
Occasionally, there are harrowing situations racing to track down victims from live streaming video. 
Reports jumped during the pandemic, he says: ""Over the recent May bank holiday weekend, we had more than 2,000 reports.""
In 2020, IWF received 300,000 reports and 153,000 were verified to be new CSAM content.
Police say more child predators can now be found on messaging apps, rather than on the dark web. Many don't even encrypt their web traffic.
Many authorities are concerned that 
 end-to-end encryption on messages sent over Messenger and Instagram Direct. 
End-to-end encryption is a privacy feature that makes it impossible for anyone except the sender and recipient to read messages sent online.
Authorities are concerned by Facebook's plan, saying it will make it much harder to apprehend suspects and detect child predators.
Facebook says using such technology will protect users' privacy. 
But the US, UK and Australia have repeatedly objected to the idea since 2019, saying it will jeopardise work to combat child abuse. 
Australia has also demanded the tech industry hand over private encryption keys - backdoors to their networks - to authorities. Firms, both abroad and in Australia, refused. 
Enabling backdoors would be bad, says Jenny Afia, head of Schillings' legal team: ""Any legally-enforced weakening of the encryption algorithm, or vulnerability placed within the software...would potentially allow criminals to exploit [it].
""It is worth bearing in mind that having end-to-end encryption in place has already prevented a lot of crime.""
Supporters of encryption also point out that it provides a secure means of communication for dissidents and whistleblowers and making keys available could put them in jeopardy.
Edward Snowden, the NSA whistleblower who first highlighted mass surveillance to the public, 
 if governments prevent end-to-end encryption or insist on backdoors.  
Netsweeper in Canada catalogues the internet to help schools and internet service providers block harmful content.
It sees a quarter of the world's internet traffic and is in 37% of British schools, scanning 100 million new URLs daily. Up to 300 URLs are reported to IWF daily. 
""To date, governments have left the large tech companies alone - probably because they didn't understand them as much as they do now,"" says Netsweeper's chief executive Perry Roach.
""But if we don't enable law enforcement with sophisticated tools, it will allow criminals, scammers, paedophiles and terrorists to move across the internet undetected."" 
Software engineer Brian Bason founded US firm Bark after giving his sons their first mobile phones. 
Bark uses AI neural networks to analyse text messages and social media in milliseconds for bullying, online predation, child abuse, signs of depression and suicidal ideas. 
Children have to agree to hand over their login credentials, but only relevant sections of messages are sent in alerts to parents and schools.
Bark has informed the FBI of nearly a thousand child predators over the last five years.
""The reality is end-to-end encryption will drastically reduce the amount of CSAM material reported to authorities,"" Mr Bason tells the BBC. ""To me, the trade-off is not worth it.""
Perhaps these firms disagree because their business models rely on having unfettered access to data pipelines. 
However, former UK and US intelligence agency staff tell the BBC there are other successful methods investigators can use if end-to-end encryption is introduced, like phishing, where users are tricked into visiting fake websites and handing over login credentials.
Internet giants should use machine learning to detect child predator behaviour on the device or server, they add, which wouldn't break encryption, as it occurs only after the message has been decrypted. 
Thorn, a US foundation that develops software to combat child exploitation, identifies eight child victims and 215 pieces of child abuse material per day.  
Sarah Gardner, VP of external affairs at Thorn, suggests using 
 - a form of encryption that lets users perform computations on encrypted data, without first decrypting it.
Another option would be to invest in better solutions, she adds.
Edinburgh-based Cyan Forensics, which uses statistical sampling to scan suspects' devices for CSAM content in just 10 minutes, agrees.
""End-to-end encryption is here already and it's neither good nor bad,"" says Cyan Forensics' co-founder and chief executive Ian Stevenson.
""However, there is a dire need for broader protocols to ensure the safety of children online.""
Former detective constable Alan McConnell, who worked on more than a hundred child sex abuse cases, left Police Scotland to teach Cyan about the problems the police face.
As a result of his work, a major UK police force used Cyan's software to detect CSAM material on an ex-offender's computer in March. The individual was found to have surreptitiously installed cameras at a club used by children. 
However, a senior German prosecutor says his biggest problem is getting tech firms to play ball. 
""We're addressing all the big tech firms - please help us,"" says Markus Hartmann, director of North Rhine-Westphalia's central cybercrime department.
""You hear they have these big teams fighting digital crimes, and I wonder, why don't they file any complaints with law enforcement?""
His unit recently busted a child pornography ring, charging 65 suspects and rescuing a 13-year-old child. 
They were aided by Microsoft, which scanned its database of Skype users to locate the suspects' IP addresses.
Mr Hartmann is surprisingly in favour of encryption.
""If you break encryption, put in backdoors or ban it, then you're doing more harm than good... and I doubt the guys we are really going after, will not be able to get around it,"" he says.
""Even as a prosecutor, I could set up my own end-to-end encrypted network in two days, routed through public libraries.""",,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57050689,Should encryption be curbed to combat child abuse?
"This makes China the second country after the US to operate a rover there. 
The Zhurong robot is due to study the planet's surface rocks and atmosphere. It will also look for signs of life, including any subsurface water or ice. 
China's Tianwen-1 mission, consisting of an orbiter, lander and rover, was launched in July last year.
The deputy chief commander of the mission, Zhang Yuhua, said the rover was designed to operate for 92 Earth days (or 90 Mars days, known as ""sols"", which are slightly longer than Earth days) and would share its data via the orbiter. 
""We hope we can get a comprehensive covering of Martian topography, landform and environment, and the exploratory data of the radar detecting the Martian subsurface during one Martian year,"" she said.
""By doing so, our country will have our own abundant and first-hand data about Martian resources.""
The solar-powered, 240kg (530lb) six-wheeled robot - named after a Chinese mythical fire god - will be exploring Utopia Planitia in Mars' northern hemisphere.
This colossal basin - more than 3,000km (1,860 miles) wide - was likely formed by an impact early in the planet's history. There is some evidence pointing to it having held an ocean long ago.
Remote sensing by satellites indicates there are significant stores of ice at depth.
Utopia Planitia is where Nasa landed its Viking-2 mission in 1976.

"The rapper, 34, gripped his son's shoulder throughout his speech, before hoisting him into the air and saying: ""I want to dedicate this award to you.""
The three year old burst into tears, and left the stage clinging to his father's leg.
Meanwhile, The Weeknd was the night's big winner, taking home 10 awards.
Among his prizes were best artist; top Hot 100 album for After Hours; and top Hot 100 song for Blinding Lights.
The star, whose real name is Abel Tesfaye, more than doubled his career total of Billboard Music Awards, having previously received nine trophies.
Korean pop band BTS also picked up four prizes, winning best group for the second time in three years; and top social artist for the fifth consecutive year.
The band are now just one year short of equalling Justin Bieber's six-year hold on the social award from 2011- 2016.
Here are some of the other highlights and talking points from the show.
Best rock artist winner Machine Gun Kelly arrived at the ceremony with a rather unusual oral condition: A jet-black tongue. Had he gone overboard with the charcoal toothpaste? Developed a crippling liquorice habit? Been cursed by an evil dentist?
Sadly not. A visit to his Instagram reveals that the musician had someone paint his tongue carefully with a cotton bud. 
On the red carpet, he made sure everyone noticed, sticking his tongue out for fans, sticking his tongue out for the cameras, and (hold your stomachs) touching tongues with his girlfriend, Megan Fox.
His reasons are still unclear. Is it a reference to The Rolling Stones Paint It Black? Or is he simply a big fan of giraffes? We may never know. 
Pink accepted the Icon Award from rock star Bon Jovi, and confessed she'd been obsessed with the star when she was eight - locking herself in her bedroom for a week after he got married.  
""I'm very glad you found lasting love, Jon, but you broke my heart. I take this as an apology,"" she laughed, indicating her trophy.
To celebrate her prize, the star performed a career-spanning medley of hits, including Who Know, Get The Party Started and Just Give Me A Reason.
But the highlight was a breathtaking aerial acrobatic routine, performed with her nine-year-old daughter Willow, set to their duet Cover Me In Sunshine.
BTS joined the ceremony remotely from South Korea, posing on their own red carpet (!) to accept the prize for top-selling song - their first English-language single, Dynamite.
""It's really an honour to be the winner of such a significant title,"" said RM. ""We wanted to share some fresh energy with everyone through Dynamite, and we think [with] this award, we achieved that goal.""
Dressed in suave black suits, the band also gave a sensationally-choreographed performance of their new single, Butter, which broke Spotify records on its release last Friday.
Pop Smoke, who died in February 2020 at the age of 20, won five prizes, including top new artist and top Billboard Hot 200 album, for he posthumously-released Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the Moon.
His mother Audrey Jackson gave an emotional speech as she collected the latter award on his behalf.
""Thank you to the fans for honouring the life and spirit of my son, so much that he continues to manifest as if he were still here in flesh,"" she said. 
""He created music for the kid who has to sleep four in a room, the kid who has to figure out how to get to school each day so he can graduate and make his mom proud. He did this so that 14 year olds would not have to kill to prove they are somebody.""
""That is the irony in this,"" she added. ""So thank you to the Billboard Awards leadership for honouring my young warrior. Bashar Barakah Jackson, we call your name."" 
The Jonas Brothers reunited to close the ceremony, with host Nick Jonas joining brothers Joe and Kevin to perform a medley of hits including Sucker, Only Human and new single Love Me Before You Leave Me.
Nick was accompanied for the night by his wife, the actress Priyanka Chopra -  and, as usual, they put together a stunning ensemble for the red carpet.
Chopra wore a custom shimmering gold gown with a thigh-high slit, designed by Dolce and Gabbana, embellished with a belt that's previously been worn by Naomi Campbell and Beyonce.
Jonas complemented her with an emerald green designer suit from Fendi - prompting Chopra to

Drake used his artist of the decade speech to reassure up-and-coming musicians that even the most successful artists worry about the quality of their songs.
""Even if I do a good job I always wonder if I could have done better,"" he said. 
""For anyone who's watching this that's wondering how this happened, you know that's really the answer. It's being so unsure of how you're getting it done that you just kind of keep going in the hopes of figuring out the formula.""
""I didn't really write a grandiose speech about how to make it work or what it took, 'cause you know, to be really honest with you I don't quite understand it myself,"" he added.
Doja Cat and SZa's Kiss Me More is shaping up to be 2021's song of the summer - and their debut performance of the track only amplified its irresistible charms.
Doja sported a monochrome look with 60s-inspired make-up, as she snapped in and out of sync with a troupe of dancers wearing spherical orange helmets.
For her verse, SZA appeared on a revolving staircase, her golden-sunset waves bringing a burst of colour to the stage; as kaleidocopic graphics swept across the video screens.
Their vocals were flawless, despite two Janet Jackson-level dance breakdowns, with the singers ending the performance with a gravity-defying, muscle-shredding double backbend.
Alicia Keys' breakthrough album was released 20 years ago next month, and the star celebrated the anniversary by taking viewers through the record's biggest songs.
Seated at a white upright piano, she played the opening track Piano & I, which riffs on Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, while reflecting on her career to date.
""I remember when they doubted me - but we flipped it,"" she said. ""And now I got all this wisdom, and I'm never leaving the keys, because I know what I'm worth"".
That was the cue for A Woman's Worth, which she played on a red keyboard, before switching instruments again - hammering out her Prince cover How Come You Don't Call Me on a rainbow-splattered piano.
Keys wrapped up the performance with her debut single, Fallin' - which, in a video introduction, Michelle Obama had described hearing for the first time.
""It was edgy and soulful, graceful yet raw,"" said the former first lady. ""This young singer was taking us to church and to the symphony and to a candlelight dinner and couples therapy and everywhere else all in a little more than three minutes.

"First, does everyone hate us, and if so, why?
""Yet again, politics is being blamed - but wrongly,"" 
. ""The UK was simply outsung and outclassed by smaller countries who made more effort.""
Question answered. Tick.
Second - the more important and thorny conundrum - how can the UK be good at Eurovision again, and who is up to the challenge for 2022?
A number of performers, songwriters and producers have valiantly thrown their hats into the ring, willing to risk their careers in the hope that they can restore some national pride. 
Newman ""should hold his head up high and we should not come out of Eurovision in my opinion, because it's the most joyous evening of the entire year musically"", said Cheryl Baker, who brought the Eurovision trophy home as part of Bucks Fizz in 1981.
""But we do need to take on board that they are powerful songs,"" she told BBC Breakfast. ""We need big production. That's what they want in Europe. Big production, big songs, big voices, That's what we need to do.""
Asked for his tips, Damiano David, the lead singer of Italy's 2021 winning group Måneskin, suggested on BBC Breakfast: ""Just try with a band!""
, critic Ed Power said the obvious lesson from Newman's result was that ""the worst sin a singer at the competition can commit is to be bland"", adding: ""There is a Eurovision spirit and it is steeped in outrageousness, kitsch, flamboyance and choruses that go off like confetti bombs.""
Superfan Danny Lynch told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""The problem with James's song was it was nice but it was just playing safe. The UK are trying to play safe and I think we need to take risks.""
So who could be the hero to take that risk?
A campaign is gathering steam after the comedian, classically-trained musician and Strictly Come Dancing winner put himself forward to fly the flag at Italia 2022.
He has proven that he can upset the odds and triumph in a popular vote by winning Strictly in December - and we know he would be able to manage an impressive dance routine.
He is a consummate entertainer and musician. He has called Eurovision ""Satan's karaoke"" and tried to enter in 2008, but said he was put off by the ""hoops"" he was asked to jump through.
""I wrote this eco-anthem about the world and saving the world and it was this bashing, crashing anthem,"" he said afterwards. ""I used a quote from Dad's Army and the title was Put That Light Out Mr Hodges.
""It was all about being told to put the light because the power is going to ruin the world and we've lost the keys to Eden. It was great and I even did a recording, then they bleat on about jumping through hoops.""
Has his time finally come?
One option is to enlist a pop group with a pedigree of chart success. The last time the UK finished higher than 15th was in 2011, when Blue came 11th.
Could Steps, who have had hits around Europe and made their latest comeback last autumn, step into the breach next year? One of their members is up for it.
But he will have a job to persuade the others.
, and Faye Tozer summed up the reason most established artists are reluctant to enter.
""In an ideal world, everybody has this vision of Steps going to Eurovision and being the perfect act, with the perfect song, and we turn it around for the UK,"" she said. ""But I think in reality, it's just never, ever going to happen, so it's weighing up whether it's worth that risk to us or not.""
Anything but bland, these drag supergroups are made up of contestants from Ru Paul's Drag Race UK, and would provide a blast of fresh air to the British entry.
The United Kingdolls reached number 27 in the UK chart last year with their single UK Hun. The Frock Destroyers released their debut album in December, and its main songwriter is pretty confident Eurovision will happen.
A petition to send them to Italy has 11,000 signatures.
Meanwhile, a collaboration is brewing between another Drag Race star, Tia Kofi, and electropop queen Little Boots.
When Måneskin won on Sunday, Damiano David used their acceptance speech to proclaim: ""Rock and roll never dies!"" And next year, as a result of their success, we're likely to see more bands at Eurovision.
UK rock producer Romesh Dodangoda, who has worked with groups like Motorhead, Bring Me The Horizon and Funeral For a Friend, has already offered his services.
If we're looking for something different (and we are), then a bit of bhangra - as suggested by author Tasha Suri and her family - could work brilliantly.
The UK has bigger and better pop stars than the rest of Europe put together, right? So why not just send one of them?
The Telegraph music critic Neil McCormick suggests that, if we want to prove whether Europe really hates us, Sir Paul McCartney should write a song for Adele to perform. (Although Adele can write quite decent songs of her own.)
There is another perennial piece of logic that says, lots of other European countries send their biggest pop stars, who have already proven their talent and appeal - which is true - so why can't the UK?
The answer is, artists who might already be big in their home countries have more to gain and less to lose than Brits who are already global stars.
Despite how wounded British fans get when we finish last, the UK - unlike many other countries - has largely treated Eurovision as a bit of a joke for decades. Not many people want to be associated with Eurovision at all, let alone with the prospect of being humiliated at Eurovision.
If four fifths of Steps think Eurovision is too great a risk, what will Ed Sheeran think?
Yes, he might win - which his career does not need, and which would not win him many more fans than he already has. Or... he might have to put on a brave face while being upstaged by a group of Russian grannies.
IT IS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN.
For 2020's UK entry - which became 2021's when last year's contest was cancelled - the BBC worked with music company BMG to find an entrant, after deciding that teaming up with a record label was the best way to improve results.
A good theory. James Newman was signed to BMG and had already co-written chart-topping hits for Rudimental and Calvin Harris.
It's not known whether the BBC/BMG relationship will continue - and in 2020 BMG said they weren't only looking at their own artists for possible entrants. But 
 could be a good place to start when guessing who might carry next year's hopes.

"With the coronavirus pandemic in full swing, the UK jobs market had come to a standstill - hardly any firms were hiring.
Young people like Olivia, 22, were particularly badly affected, as official figures showed. While the UK 
, it soared to 
.
""It was so competitive, and I just didn't know how I was going to find a job,"" says Olivia, from Essex, who got a degree in creative media practice from Bath Spa University.
She wanted to find a job in marketing, and for a few months she took a very traditional approach - sending out her CV and hoping for the best. Unfortunately all she got was 30 rejections. And there were no unpaid internships available either.
""I felt lonely trying to figure out how to make a dent in the industry, but without anyone to turn to,"" she says.
Ultimately Olivia realised that she would have to take matters into her own hands and think creatively. So she set up her own Instagram page and business called Living Lavish Social, a social media marketing company. It gives advice to business owners about how to market their companies on Instagram.
Within weeks she had got her first client, and her second followed soon after. ""I would split up my day with job hunting, upskilling, and then working on the business.""
Gemma Stephenson, a expert on graduate job hunting, says that the use of social media to find work, or set up your own business or network, has been a growing trend among university leavers during the pandemic.
""There's been so much hardship for graduates,"" says Gemma, who is also the co-host of a careers podcast with the irreverent title of Let's Get You a [expletive] Job.
""But instead of admitting defeat, some have used social media to their advantage, building businesses from scratch, and showcasing their talents not just to their new clients, but potential employers too.""
When Naomi Hollas, a 2019 graduate from Glasgow university, was put on furlough from her events jobs last March she felt deflated. A month later she was made redundant, and there were no other jobs out there in her sector.
""The events industry just had to stop abruptly, with no guidance or support,"" says the 25-year-old. ""It was heart-breaking to watch. From a recent graduate perspective, we had just had a taste of the industry and all of a sudden it was taken away from us.""
By June, Naomi admits she was feeling that she was exhausting her options. She had contacted people in her industry on Linkedin, but was getting nothing in return.
Feeling a bit lost, she started a private Facebook group, called Eventgrads, to build an online community for people who had graduated with an events degree.
""I shared it across my socials, and the number of members started to grow - going beyond my network,"" says Naomi. ""Before I knew it I had nearly 2,000 people, and industry experts were talking about it.""
She says that the Facebook group turned into the community she'd yearned for. ""We were discussing everything from the roadmap, to recovery, to how we can build and support the events industry in other ways,"" she says.
""To be able to discuss and connect with others who understand what you are going through was beneficial to so many of us.""
Naomi also branched out to Instagram and Twitter - sharing advice for graduates and those in the industry. Before she knew it, she was spending all her time working on the platform - hosting weekly Zoom calls with the group, updating the jobs board, and even setting up talks and mentoring programmes.
Both Naomi and Olivia say starting their social media platforms, and the focus it gave them, was hugely beneficial in the middle of what could otherwise have been a mentally challenging time for them.
""Starting Eventgrads was something to help me control the uncontrollable, a goal to focus on when everything was a bit hectic,"" says Naomi.
Olivia agrees: ""Having the business to work on gave me purpose, I gained so much confidence. My Instagram account also allowed me to connect with people who were going through similar struggles - it felt like an extended university, full of like-minded people.""
She adds: ""My business was always the one thing that came up in interviews too - potential employers loved that I'd been proactive and spent my downtime creating a platform to gain more experience.""
Olivia has now landed a job as a marketing and social coordinator for a skincare company, and still runs her start-up on the side.
Naomi has also subsequently found work, with an events business, and says that her Facebook group helped her get the job. She says her employer was ""really impressed with the whole concept, and said it showed initiative"".
With UK unemployment among 16 to 24-year-olds still high - the latest official figure is 13.3% - Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, says it is ""no surprise that some graduates are coming up with innovative solutions, like self-promotion via video clips or social media campaigns, to try and stand out from the crowd"". 
Olivia adds: ""There is often the expectation, when you leave university, that you're going to get a job handed to you on a plate, but sometimes you have to go beyond the traditional methods of job hunting to get noticed.""",,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57185042,'My Instagram account gave me confidence and purpose'
"""Miss? What's that?"" said a nine-year-old boy, pointing towards the waves, as they walked along Blackpool promenade.
It turned out he'd never seen the sea before.
A surprise, given the school is in the middle of Blackpool and only a few streets from the seafront.
Other teachers have had similar experiences over the years on school trips outside the city, she explains. A 10-year-old once asked what a duck was, while a pupil - spotting cows in the field - said: ""Look at those horses.""
""As a school, we're in a very built-up area in Blackpool,"" Kim explains. ""We've had some very extreme examples of our children with nature.""
Westminster Primary Academy is in an area with few green spaces where wildlife and nature are in short supply. 
Although many children live only minutes from the beach, they may not get to spend much time there. And while Blackpool is surrounded by spectacular countryside, such as the Forest of Bowland, Kim says many parents don't have cars or can't afford public transport.
""They're just not getting the opportunities a lot of other children would get,"" she adds. ""So, we thought, 'well, let's bring nature to them'.""
Kim is now outdoor education lead at the primary school, which became a Nature Friendly School two years ago. The scheme, which aims to make school grounds greener and wilder, is a partnership between The Wildlife Trusts, mental health charity YoungMinds, and several other nature organisations.
The project trains teachers to deliver outdoor classes, inspiring their pupils to learn more about environmental challenges and the natural world, and encouraging teamwork, social skills, confidence and creativity.
Nature Friendly Schools has already worked with 90 schools in areas with high levels of social deprivation, giving thousands of pupils the opportunity to learn and play in nature.
The leaders hope to expand the programme this year to help children find solace in nature after the hardships of lockdowns.
The Wildlife Trusts chief executive Craig Bennett says spending time outside, engaging with and learning about nature, is paramount to children's education. 
""Sadly, so many children go to school in areas where there is very little access to green space,"" he says.  
""At The Wildlife Trusts, we want to break down barriers that inhibit children from spending time in nature - including during the school day.""
Westminster Academy now has an outdoor classroom as well as a pond, more trees and wildflowers, a trim-trail and an outdoor gym. 
The teachers incorporate nature into the curriculum as much as they can, says Kim. ""What we're trying to do as a school is to get our children to like, respect and admire nature, so that - as they grow up - they understand the significance and importance of keeping it safe and keeping our planet safe.""
In lessons outside, children learn about threats to bees, including climate change, habitat loss and pesticides. 
Pond dipping is a perennial favourite, not just to identify water creatures, but to learn about physical forces through studying floating objects.
""The children absolutely love it,"" she says. ""A lot of them say it doesn't feel like learning even though we know we're learning and that's what makes it so good for them.""
When Kim asked her young charges to say what they liked about outdoor learning, the responses were heart-warming. 
""One girl said, 'I just love discovering new creatures.' Another explained, 'When I'm outside, it doesn't feel like learning, because it's so much fun and I just know that my brain is getting bigger'.""

"Experts warn that the real number of fatalities might be much higher as many deaths are not officially recorded.
India has recorded 26 million cases - second only to the US - and is now the epicentre of the global pandemic.
The country is also only the third in the world to record more than 300,000 deaths  - behind the US and Brazil.
 to record its last 100,000 deaths. 
A deadly second wave in recent weeks has overwhelmed the country's healthcare system, with hospitals struggling to cope with the influx of patients and with critical drugs and oxygen running out.
Nearly half of India's virus deaths occurred in the last three months. 
In the last 26 days alone, the country has recorded 102,533 Covid-19 deaths. 
Some experts say the number of daily deaths may rise further.  Dr Murad Banaji, a mathematician at Middlesex University London, has been tracking the pandemic closely.  
""We expect a delay between cases peaking and deaths peaking. But also, as with cases, we know there are huge variations in death surveillance and recording between states, and between urban and rural areas,"" he told the BBC. 
""Even once recorded fatalities start to fall, we'll need to be wary of reading too much into this until we stop hearing reports of large numbers of rural deaths,"" Dr Banaji said.  
Over the past days, 
 linked to Covid treatment have added to the overall crisis. 
In some places, even crematoriums have run out of space and have been forced to expand to makeshift sites in public parks.

"Bob Dylan sang those wise words at the tender age of 23, on his track My Back Pages.
As he reaches his 80th birthday on Monday, we've decided to ignore the advice of the famous Dylan documentary Don't Look Back and celebrate the life and career of the US singer-songwriter.
Be warned though before we get started, this list is about as long and exhaustive as some of the verses on 
...
Bob Dylan is not his given birth name. But you already knew that, right? So here are 79 more facts about the artist formerly known as Robert Allen Zimmerman.
 He has sold more than 125 million albums around the world. 
Despite his success and cultural impact, Dylan has never had a number one single in the UK or US. For context, Mr Blobby, Crazy Frog and Las Ketchup have all topped the charts.
A poll of musicians, writers and academics, conducted on Dylan's 70th birthday, 
, which the singer once said was his most honest and direct work. ""After that I wasn't interested in writing a novel or a play,"" he said. ""I knew I wanted to write songs because it was just a whole new category.""
. Bruce Springsteen said the track, with its opening snare kick, sounded like ""somebody kicked open the door to your mind"". While another high-profile fan, U2's Bono, called it ""a black eye of a pop song"".
 When asked what his songs were about, in a 1966 interview with Playboy magazine, Dylan quipped: ""Some are about four minutes, some are about five, and some, believe it or not, are about eleven or twelve.""
 Surprisingly to many, the counterculture icon did not play at the 1969 Woodstock festival. Dylan was a Woodstock resident at the time (the festival was actually about 40 miles away) but he got a better offer - £35,000 to headline the Isle of Wight festival instead, with The Beatles watching on.
. Speaking of The Fab Four... Dylan was the first man to introduce the band to marijuana, Sir Paul McCartney recently revealed to Uncut. 'We all ran into the backroom going, 'Give us a bit!'"" said Sir Macca. ""So that was the very first evening we ever got stoned!""
. Many of his songs are more familiar to mainstream audiences as 
. For example Adele's version of Make You Feel My Love, The Byrds' Mr Tambourine Man and All Along The Watchtower by Jimi Hendrix. ""He played [my songs] the way I would have done them if I was him,"" he said of the late guitarist. Dylan himself has recorded covers of Frank Sinatra and Paul Simon tunes.
 Malibu resident Dylan has 17 houses around the world according to biographer Howard Sounes. One of them is reportedly in the Scottish Highlands.
 The troubadour has won 10 Grammy awards, including three for his 1997 album Time Out of Mind, which many critics considered to be a return to form after a long artistic slump.
He was born into a Jewish family in Duluth, Minnesota, before moving upstate to Hibbing.
 Country singer Hank Williams, and bluesmen Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker were among his musical heroes growing up, along with the king of rock 'n' roll Elvis Presley. The Rebel Without a Cause James Dean was his celluloid hero.
Dylan saw Buddy Holly play live locally just a few days before he died in a plane crash.
 As a youngster he played piano and guitar in several summer camp/high school bands. Their names included The Jokers, The Shadow Blasters, The Golden Chords and (our personal favourite) The Rock Boppers.
 He wrote in his high school year book that it was his ambition ""to join Little Richard"".
Working as busboy in a Fargo restaurant, after finishing high school, remains the only normal job Dylan has ever done. But in another life he'd like to have been a soldier. In his 2004 memoir Chronicles he wrote he'd always pictured himself ""dying in some heroic battle rather than a bed"".
After moving to Minneapolis to study he turned his attention to folk music, swapping his electric guitar for an acoustic, which he played in cafes around the city's bohemian Dinkytown area.
He became totally enchanted by US folk singers like Odetta and Woody Guthrie, who he would later visit in a psychiatric hospital in New Jersey and play his own songs to him. 
His first original composition of any note was called Song for Woody, and he even began to sing and talk like the Oklahoma singer.
Guthrie offered Dylan his stash of unused lyrics but his young son Arlo was unable to find them when Dylan came knocking. Almost 40 years later, the lyrics were put to music by Essex folksinger Billy Bragg and Chicago band Wilco.
 In his book, Dylan revealed that aside from Guthrie and Irish folk group The Clancy Brothers, the biggest influences on his songwriting were blues legend Robert Johnson and Pirate Jenny - a song from the Brecht/Weill play The Threepenny Opera.
 Having briefly operated under the name Elston Gunn, including while playing in Bobby Vee's band, Dylan then settled on his now famous moniker - a nod to the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas.
 Dylan was a university drop-out. He never did finish his Liberal Arts degree at the University of Minnesota.
He read works by French symbolist poets like Arthur Rimbaud and American beat writers like Jack Kerouac. The On the Road writer's spontaneous style ""blew a hole in my head"", Dylan once remarked.
 He moved to New York in 1961, to chase his dream of becoming a big music star.
 He would regularly perform at venues in Greenwich Village such as Cafe Wha? and The Gaslight Cafe, where performers would pass around a basket at the end of each set and hope to be paid. Dylan once said he would get a dollar and a cheeseburger to play his harmonica all afternoon alongside another singer in the village.
 After nine months in The Big Apple he secured a deal with Colombia Records, feeding the company's PR executives ""pure hokum"", as he later put it.
His first trip abroad involved an 
 in the winter of 1962/63, where he learned traditional English folk songs like Scarborough Fair, and (for contractual reasons) cut an LP under the pseudonym Billy Boy Grunt.
Early on in his career, he would make up tales about his background, telling journalists and radio presenters that he was an orphan, from New Mexico and that he used to travel with a carnival.
 His self-titled debut album consisted largely of covers of traditional folk and blues numbers, such as The House of the Rising Sun.
 His breakthrough follow-up, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, carried a picture of him and his girlfriend at the time, Suze Rotolo, on the cover. A performance of the song Don't Think Twice, It's Alright is believed to have brought about the end of the couple's relationship.
Blowin' in the Wind, the opening track on the album, was the song that made Dylan famous - initially thanks to the Peter, Paul and Mary version - and it also forever aligned with him the civil rights movement and anti-war protests.
The song has a similar melody to that of the African American spiritual song No More Auction Block. It came about as musician Agnes 'Sis' Cunningham urged artists like Dylan to put contemporary activist lyrics to old tunes which she then published in her Broadside magazine.
Dylan performed the number near to Dr Martin Luther King Jr at a march on Washington DC in 1963, becoming the voice of a generation in the process - a label he always rejected.
He said that Dr King's famous I Have a Dream speech that day affected him ""in a profound way"".
 At the 1965 Newport Folk Festival, Dylan shocked fans and the music world by plugging in and rocking out, backed by a band that had been hastily-arranged the night before.
. For the next year or so on tour around the world, Dylan and his band The Hawks were regularly booed when they went electric - including at London's Royal Albert Hall. He was famously even called ""Judas"" by one gig-goer in Manchester. ""I don't believe you,"" replied Dylan. ""You're lying"".
The period that followed - with his trilogy of more abstract and surrealist bluesy folk rock albums, Bringing it All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde - saw Dylan turn pop music into an art form, according to Sean Latham, director of the Institute for Bob Dylan Studies at the University of Tulsa. 
Speaking on Radio 4's documentary series, 
, Mr Latham said: ""The closest parallels we can draw in fact are not to other pop stars but to say Picasso or James Joyce.""
Dylan married Sara Lownds, who had worked as a model, in secret in 1965, and they had four children together. He also adopted her daughter from a prior marriage.
For a short while they lived at the famous Chelsea Hotel in New York.
 One of their sons, Jakob, became known as the frontman of the 1990s band The Wallflowers.
 Dylan did a screen test at Andy Warhol's studio, aka The Factory, and walked away with a print of an Elvis portrait.
He was injured in a mysterious motorbike accident in July 1966.
The singer then stopped touring and became a bit of a recluse for most of the rest of the 60s, living in a remote artists' colony in Woodstock, upstate New York. ""Truth was that I wanted to get out of the rat race,"" he wrote in Chronicles. ""Having children changed my life and segregated me from just about everybody and everything that was going on.""
During this period he learned to paint, read the bible and would jam with his with 1966 touring bandmates - who would become affectionately known as The Band. The collection of historical ballads and traditional songs they recorded were released many years later under the name The Basement Tapes.
The Band's star-studded final gig, which featured Dylan, was later the subject of a Martin Scorsese documentary entitled The Last Waltz.
Fans broke into Dylan's property (and bed), and he eventually moved back to Greenwich Village, where he was similarly hounded by Dylanologists.
 The star rarely read the contracts he signed early on, and as a result he and his long-trusted manager Albert Grossman ended up suing each other in the 1980s.
Re-inventing himself again as a country singer, he wrote Wanted Man with Johnny Cash. Cash debuted the track live at San Quentin prison in 1969.
. His 1975 album Blood on the Tracks tackled the topic of his separation from Sara.
Its opening track Tangled Up in Blue saw him experiment with timeless painting-style techniques in the muddled narrative of the song. The singer said it took ""ten years to live and two years to write"".
Dylan returned to the live circuit in 1974, playing arenas with The Band - one of the first major tours of its kind.
The following year he gathered a collection of entertainers - including beat poet Allen Ginsberg, singers Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, and violinist Scarlet Rivera - for a travelling circus-esque US tour called the The Rolling Thunder Revue. Dylan even drove a motor home for the circuit of small town venues, which was mythologised in a Scorsese Netflix film.
The finale of the first leg of the tour constituted a benefit concert for imprisoned boxer Ruben Carter - the subject of Dylan's recent song The Hurricane - and featured an appearance from fighting champion and activist Muhammad Ali.
At times during the unique tour, Dylan painted his face white and wore a mask, while former girlfriend Baez dressed up as him.
Baez has stated that the lyrics to her song Diamonds and Rust relate to her relationship with her fellow singer.
 He started to re-imagine his songs at this time, reworking the tempos and styles so they were almost unrecognisable. A decade later, after sustaining a debilitating hand injury, Dylan said a jazz singer inspired him to play and sing his songs using a totally different technique.
 In 1978, Dylan released a cubist-inspired film he had written and directed during The Rolling Thunder Revue tour, called Renaldo and Clara. The almost four-hour long feature starred his (by-then ex) wife Sara and Baez, as The Woman in White, and it was an expensive flop at the box office.
Dylan had a period of Christian revelation in the late 1970s, following his divorce, after a fan threw a small silver cross on stage. He got baptised and released several albums containing contemporary gospel songs like Gotta Serve Somebody.
Speaking about his faith in 1997, however, the musician told Newsweek: ""I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music, I don't find it anywhere else. I don't adhere to rabbis, preachers, evangelists all of that, I've learned more from the songs than I have from any of this entity.""
Sporting a dangly earring, Dylan played a rather ragged rendition of Blowin' In the Wind at the global charity event Live Aid in 1985, backed by Rolling Stones guitarists Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood at Philadelphia's JFK Stadium.
His song Blind Willie McTell, a tribute to the late bluesman, was released in 1991, oddly eight years after it was recorded.
 Dylan married his backup singer Carolyn Dennis in 1986 and they had a daughter together, before divorcing in 1992. This second marriage remained a secret until Sounes' book, Down the Highway, was first published in 2001.
He formed a supergroup called The Traveling Wilburys in 1988, with his famous friends George Harrison, Tom Petty, Roy Orbison and Jeff Lynne. They each had band nicknames and Dylan was known as Lucky. Lucky Wilbury.
He was inducted into the The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame that year too.
. His album Love and Theft was released on 11 September 2001 - the same day as the plane attacks on New York City.
Dylan won an Oscar and a Golden Globe award earlier that year for his track Things Have Changed, which featured in the Michael Douglas movie Wonder Boys.
 He had his own weekly one-hour satellite radio show, Theme Time Radio Hour, from 2006 to 2009.
Dylan's name appears on the wall of Blackpool's Opera House, alongside other acts to have performed there, such as comedians Little and Large and Roy Chubby Brown.
He's a hip-hop fan. Dylan raved about Ice-T, Public Enemy, NWA and Run-DMC: ""They were all poets and knew what was going on,"" he wrote. Some consider his own 1965 track Subterranean Homesick Blues to be one of the first modern rap songs.
He's also allegedly a master thief. Chronicles: Volume One (to give it its full title) was a New York times best-seller, however critics claimed its author, Dylan, had cribbed certain passages from Marcel Proust, Mark Twain, Time magazine and even a guide to New Orleans.
The 2007 Dylan-inspired film I'm Not There became Heath Ledger's last movie to be released during the actor's lifetime.
A 160ft wide Dylan mural by Brazilian street artist Eduardo Kobra (pictured below) was unveiled in downtown Minneapolis in 2015.
Dylan was awarded the 
 in 2012 by then-Present Barack Obama; before receiving the Nobel Prize for Literature four years later, for having ""created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition"". He became the first songwriter to win the prestigious award, but it was 
, who nervously sang A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall.
He eventually delivered a Nobel lecture in the form of a spoken word piece with added piano tinkling and references to the plays of William Shakespeare and Homer's hero, Odysseus. ""My songs are alive in the land of the living, but songs are unlike literature, they are meant to be sung and not read,"" he explained.
 The last British gig of Dylan's so-called Never Ending Tour, which kicked off in 1988, saw him and Neil Young co-headline a UK show for the first time, at 
. He's played roughly 100 gigs a year for the last 20 years.
His first new song in eight years was released last year and it comprised of a 
 It made Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands, his 11 minute-plus epic from 1966, seem pretty poppy by comparison. 
 In December, he sold the rights to his entire song catalogue to Universal Music Group (UMG) for an undisclosed fee. The New York Times claimed the deal could be worth more than $300m (£225m).
Dylan has been a keen painter and visual artist for decades and his work is currently on display and up for sale at the Castle Fine Art gallery in Manchester.
 Last week, it emerged Dylan had agreed to become an honorary patron of the The Bob Willis Fund - a new charity in memory of the late England cricketer. ""Bob Willis was a great sportsman who left too soon,"" Dylan noted. ""I'm happy to help keep his flame and cause alive.""
 that he had changed his middle name to Dylan as a young man, in honour of his favourite musician.
The Bob Dylan Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma - a museum dedicated to artefacts from his huge archive - will open to the public in May next year.

"Epic, maker of the hit video game Fortnite, claims Apple's tight control over iPhone apps hurts competition. 
During his appearance, Mr Cook argued that keeping control of the App Store helped keep iPhones secure.
He also said he did not know if the App Store made a profit, telling the court Apple did not break down the figures.
Facing questions about the level of profit the App Store generates from the 30% commission it takes on sales, he said: ""We don't have a separate profit and loss statement for the App Store.""
Instead, he said that he had a ""feeling"" that it was profitable - but could not share figures with the court. 
Mr Cook was being questioned about his oversight of top-level decisions around the App Store's policies.
Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers also questioned Mr Cook, asking about a survey that showed 39% of developers are dissatisfied with the app store.
Mr Cook said he was not familiar with the survey but said there was a ""friction"" because Apple rejected 40% of apps weekly.
The judge also asked him if he was a gamer, to which he admitted that he was not. 
Mr Cook's opposite number in the case - Epic Games chief Tim Sweeney - has already appeared on the stand in the opening days of the long-running legal battle. 
Two main things are at the centre of the case: the 30% commission Apple takes on in-app purchases, and the fact that no other app stores are allowed to exist on the iPhone and iPad to offer an alternative. 
Epic's Fortnite is one of the most popular games in the world and makes its money through in-game purchases of character costumes and other digital items.  
A 30% cut on millions of such purchases adds up to a lot - but Apple's rules forbid the company from circumventing its payment methods if a sale is made in the iPhone app. 
In August last year, Fortnite offered players a 20% discount if they paid Epic Games directly, in direct violation of Apple's rules. 
 from its store - as did Google, which enforces a similar policy.
Epic had clearly expected that to happen. The firm immediately launched a PR blitz to mobilise its fanbase and win support, painting Apple as a dominating force suppressing freedom of choice. 
Within hours, Epic lodged prepared legal complaints in the US against both Apple and Google. 
But the debate goes beyond the 30% cut, to wider questions about competitiveness. Epic has made no secret of the fact that it would like to run its own app stores on both iOS and Android, avoiding Apple's and Google's payment and delivery systems entirely. 
This was Tim Cook's first time giving evidence at trial. 
There's no video footage of the court case but journalists can listen in to a terrible audio line that sounds like the trial is taking place under water. It's therefore hard to get a feel for the atmosphere of court. 
Still, it's pretty clear that Mr Cook is having a tough day. 
I'm used to hearing him asked questions in Congress. Usually he has a relaxed air - it takes a lot to get him flustered. 
However a cross examination in court is a very different beast. 
Grilled by an expert legal team, Mr Cook appeared more evasive. 
He was asked, for example, how much profit Apple makes from its App Store. He replied that he didn't know. Considering the App Store is a massive money spinner for Apple, that is a surprise. 
Google also pays a huge amount to Apple to have its search preloaded onto iPhones. Asked about this deal (believed to be worth around $10bn, or £7bn) Mr Cook didn't seem to know much about it, unable - or unwilling - to confirm how much this contract was worth. 
Mr Cook may be reluctant to unveil commercially sensitive data. However, he came across as vague on detail. And that's not a good look when you're giving evidence in court. 
Most experts believe this is Apple's to lose but anti-trust cases are notoriously difficult to predict.
And we're unlikely to get a judgement soon - there is a lot of evidence the judge has to wade through.
The legal cases against Apple and Google are separate, and Apple has been the first in court.
Apple is accused of running a monopoly, subjecting all apps to a cumbersome review process, and rejecting them for all sorts of reasons. Epic contends that is unfair, while Apple says it protects customers from dodgy apps. 
Much of the early debate has been over definitions, with Epic arguing that Fortnite is more than a game, but rather a ""metaverse"" within which all sorts of experiences - 
- are held. 
But outside of the wrangling over technical definitions, there have also been some significant revelations.
The fact that Epic's model for its app store is not yet profitable is one of Apple's arguments against allowing an open system. 
 that Epic has made heavy losses with game giveaways, which cost it millions of dollars. However, in return it has gained millions of new users for its PC gaming platform - the Epic Games store - which Epic says was always its strategy. 
It has also emerged that Apple has debated lowering the 30% cut it takes in response to competition, with App Store chief 
. 
And one particularly memorable exchange was born out of a debate over adult content. 
Apple had highlighted that Epic's store hosted a store-within-a-store - Itch.io - which sells adult content. Apple gave this as an example of why it did not want third-party stores on its platforms. 
Later, while showing images of Fortnite, 
.
It showed him in a tuxedo, remarking: ""We thought it better to go with the suit than the naked banana, since we are in federal court this morning."" 
On cross-examination, Epic's attorney wanted to put to bed the ""implication"" that a naked banana might be inappropriate, resulting in Epic's marketing boss informing the court: ""It's just a banana, ma'am.""

"The 68 year old was unable to carry her sick husband out of their house and she found him burnt to death, she told Reuters news agency.
At least 15 deaths have been confirmed following Saturday's eruption of a nearby volcano, Mount Nyiragongo.
But the lava stopped short of the city's built-up area.
This avoided the level of death and destruction witnessed in 2002. It did, however, hit the Buhene district, where Ms Kabuo's home was.
""I said to myself: I can't go alone, we've been married for the best and for the worst,"" she told Reuters reflecting on what happened on Saturday.
""I went back to at least try to get him out but couldn't. I ran away and he got burned inside. I don't know what to do. I curse this day.""
Other Goma residents, a city of 670,000 according to UN estimates, are searching for missing loved ones as the city, and the region, continues to experience earth tremors.
More than 170 children are feared to be missing and 150 others had been separated from their families, the UN's children's agency, Unicef, said, adding that centres would be set up to help unaccompanied minors.
Nine of the 15 recorded deaths were killed in a traffic accident as people fled.
Four others died as they tried to escape a prison while two were burned to death, government spokesman Patrick Muyaya said on Sunday. 
The lava stopped in the Buhene district, on the outskirts of Goma, burying hundreds of houses and even large buildings. Reconstruction efforts are likely to take months.
""All the houses in Buhene neighbourhood were burned,"" Innocent Bahala Shamavu told the Associated Press news agency.
Elsewhere, lava crossed the N2 road connecting Goma to the city of Beni, severing a key aid and supply route. However, the city's airport was untouched, despite earlier reports that it had been affected.
The volcano, located 10km (six miles) from Goma, last erupted in 2002, killing 250 people and making 120,000 homeless.
Residents started leaving their houses even before the government announced an evacuation plan. At night, crowds were seen fleeing on foot with mattresses and other belongings. 
Rwandan authorities said more than 3,000 people had officially crossed from Goma. Some started to return on Sunday. Others went to higher ground to the west of the city.  
One Goma resident, Richard Bahati, said he was in his house when he heard screaming and became extremely worried as he saw the sky reddening outside. 
""I lived through the problem with this volcano in 2002. The volcano devastated all our homes and possessions,"" he said. 
A local trader, Kambere Ombeni, was among those who returned to the scene as the rubble still smouldered. ""We watched the whole neighbourhood in the Nyiragongo territory go up in smoke. The fire came right down to here. Even now we can still see lava,"" he said. 
Another resident, Irene Bauma, said people would need help from the government to rebuild their lives. 
""There's land, people, a population that has lost everything, maybe there are also deaths, who knows? We are asking the government to come and help the survivors of this eruption.""
Tom Peyre-Costa, from the Norwegian Refugee Council in Goma, told the BBC what had happened.
""The lava was pretty slow, like, 1km/h, but it didn't stop.... It started burning the houses,"" he said, adding that humanitarian organisations were already trying to address people's needs. 
Mount Nyiragongo is one of the world's more active volcanoes but there were concerns that its activity had not been properly observed by the Goma Volcano Observatory, since the World Bank cut funding amid allegations of corruption. 
Professor Mike Burton, a volcanologist at the University of Manchester in England, told the BBC that the lava in Mount Nyiragongo is particularly fluid and has the potential to move fast. 
In a report on 10 May, the observatory warned that seismic activity at Nyiragongo had increased.
Last year, the observatory's director, 
 increasing the chances of an eruption in the next few years. But he also warned that an earthquake could trigger a disaster earlier.

"That could drive an extra £700bn of economic growth by 2030, the CBI says.
The employers' organisation is launching what it says is a ""landmark"" economic plan for the next decade.
And its proposals would lead to ""prizes for everyone"", not just for some firms, the CBI's director general believes. 
""For the last five years business and government have been at odds. Brexit was very divisive,"" Tony Danker told the BBC.
""But after the events of the last five years, we find ourselves in total alignment about what needs to be done. We need to level up, we need a greener economy and, my God, we should not waste this opportunity.""
The CBI's new report, entitled ""Seize the Moment"", focuses on the government's policy agenda of addressing geographic inequalities, decarbonisation and innovation and says 2021 must be a turning point for the UK if it is to address those long term challenges. 
Among them, levelling up is the one that the government has trumpeted most in recent election campaigns. And those promises to alter the economic map of the UK have resulted in changes to the country's political map. But fulfilling those promises won't come from the wave of some magic wand.
Tony Danker says that while big ticket, regional infrastructure investments are a welcome start, they alone are not enough. 
""Transport is great, we need it. Broadband is great, we need it. But we need to turn all of that into real jobs and real growth, in skills and wages, if levelling up is going to mean anything to the people of this country,"" he says.
The CBI believes it and its members have an important role to play.
""Governments don't create jobs. Governments don't prepare people in the workplace for the skills of the future. Governments don't suddenly invent new decarbonisation technologies. That's what businesses do.""
In Hull's Alexandra Dock, a factory run by Siemens Gamesa produces 1,000 offshore wind turbine blades a year. 
At nearly 100 metres of moulded fibreglass they are high-tech pieces of equipment, and a decarbonising world will need a lot of them in the years to come. The plant has grown rapidly since it opened five years ago, in part thanks to government seed funding, and price guarantees.
""The government is doing a lot right,"" says Carl Ennis, managing director of Siemens UK.
""But it could have gone even better. The blades for some of our wind turbines are made in the UK, but the research and development and the cell (the motor the blades are attached to) are made in Denmark and Germany. 
""What has been missing is speed of action and scale of ambition,"" says Mr Ennis.
He says Germany is investing 50 times the amount the UK is in new hydrogen technology for example.
And if investments like Siemens' are going to benefit Hull, in the form of higher paid jobs for local people, more needs to be done.
Hannah Clague, an aerospace engineering graduate employed at the plant, says applications for jobs like hers have doubled since she joined, because ""it's such a sustainable career to go into and a lifelong career"".
But Hannah isn't from Hull herself. She's from Reading, a graduate from Sheffield University. 
And at the moment few locals are in a position to join her, says JJ Tatten, from the Warren Youth Project. 
""The reality is that the young people we work with are not ready to go into jobs in local tech and green industries,"" he says.
""There's no lack of will, no lack of intelligence, no lack of energy. They just need that first rung of the ladder and that access to skills. 
""There is a real danger for the young people we work with here in Hull, that if they can't get the opportunity to develop some of those skills, they won't get the opportunity to take a job in that field or that industry, and the people to fill those vacancies will have to be sourced from outside'.
The government's levelling up playbook looks something like this: pick an industry that the UK does - or should - have a natural advantage in, put in some funding, incentives and price guarantees to encourage businesses to invest, get local universities and colleges involved, use regulation to accelerate progress and government procurement to help at the customer end. 
But on top of that the CBI believes it could be playing a much bigger role in coordinating investment in regional businesses, building regional economic clusters, and determining the direction of skills training.
Specific recommendations for government policy in its report include an overhaul of the much criticised Apprenticeship Levy and a requirement that economic regulators prioritise investment and innovation. 
The CBI said it was ready to play a more proactive role in transforming the economy than previously. It sees this year as a ""once-in-a-generation opportunity to unite and agree to transform the UK economy"". 
Failure to make bold changes now would result in a return to business as usual, it said, including ""the persistently low productivity and heightened social division that followed the 2008 financial crisis"".",,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57221957,"Bury Brexit hatchet and seize new opportunities, says CBI"
"Fiame Naomi Mata'afa took the oath of office in a marquee in the parliament's gardens, leaving uncertainty over who controls the Pacific island nation.
Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, who has been prime minister for 22 years, has ignored a court order to step down.
Ms Mata'afa, 64, arrived at parliament on Monday expecting to be sworn in.
But the former deputy prime minister, who arrived alongside the chief justice, found herself barred from the building, which had been locked by allies of Mr Malielegaoi in advance of her arrival.
Instead, Ms Mata'afa and members of her Faatuatua i le Atua Samoa ua Tasi (Fast) party gathered in a marquee in parliament's gardens, in the capital Apia, with supporters looking on, and were sworn in one by one.
In a statement, the Fast party said: ""Democracy must prevail, always. There can be no exceptions from this fundamental principle. Those who claim otherwise and act accordingly play with fire.""
The ad-hoc ceremony was rejected by rivals as unofficial. Mr Malielegaoi called the improvised swearing-in ceremony ""illegal and unlawful"".
The controversy comes a month after the closest-run general election in Samoa's history, which was followed by bitter disputes and legal challenges.
Mr Malielegaoi's Human Rights Protection Party (HRPP) was ousted from power after four decades by Ms Mata'afa's insurgent Fast party. Both parties won 25 seats, but a single independent MP broke the tie in favour of the Fast. 
That led to legal manoeuvring by the HRPP, which claimed its opponents had not correctly met the quota of female MPs. Samoa's election commission revoked the results of the April vote and called a fresh election for 21 May.
But five days ahead of the re-run, the supreme court ruled against the HRPP, re-endorsing the results of the election and ordering the swearing in of Ms Mata'afa to go ahead.
After 22 years in charge, Mr Malielegaoi is the world's second longest-serving prime minister.
After serving as Polynesia's first female deputy prime minister, Ms Mata'afa success in the general election makes her only the second woman in the region to head a government.
She is the daughter of the country's first prime minister, and has been politically active since the mid-1980s.",,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-57227240,Samoa's first female PM locked out of parliament by losing opponent
"Flight FR4978 was bound for Lithuania from Greece when it was forced to switch direction for the Belarusian capital Minsk on Sunday so the authorities there could arrest dissident journalist Roman Protasevich, 26.
The pilot announced the emergency diversion, but provided no details. 
The plane was then accompanied by a fighter jet that had been scrambled to guide it to Minsk. 
In the moments beforehand, everything had been calm and nothing had appeared out of the ordinary.
""We all on the plane had panicked because we thought we were going to crash,"" Lithuanian passenger Raselle Grigoryeva told broadcaster ABC News. 
""This was a sudden dive, changing the altitude very drastically. It was very violent. I've never felt this on an airplane. Everybody was in shock,"" she said.
Flight FR4978 had turned east to Minsk just before it had reached the Lithuanian border.
Belarus had cited a bomb threat as why the flight needed to change, but the claim turned out to be false. 
Another Lithuanian passenger, named only as Mantas, told Reuters news agency that the moment the pilot announced the flight was being diverted to Minsk, Mr Protasevich stood up and opened an overhead locker containing his luggage.
""[He] took the luggage, and was trying to split things, like the computer he gave to his girlfriend,"" Mantas said. ""I think he made a mistake. There were plenty of people so he could give the things to me or other passengers and not the girlfriend, who was also, I think, arrested.""
Mantas added that he witnessed security forces at Minsk airport using sniffer dogs to search Mr Protasevich's luggage.
One passenger, who was not named, said officers had used physical force when arresting the journalist and that he appeared ""super-scared"", adding: ""I looked at him directly into his eyes and he was very sad.""
Passenger Edvinas Dimsa, 37, told AFP that it was clear that Mr Protasevich was ""very much afraid"". ""It looked like if the window had been open, he would have jumped out of it.""
Another passenger told Lithuania's Delfi news that while Mr Protasevich remained relatively calm, he was visibly trembling when he left the plane, with officers around him ""all the time"". 
""We asked him what was going on... he said: 'The death penalty awaits me here.'""
Others described how Mr Protasevich had immediately identified himself to officers, who then appeared to confiscate his passport.
The remaining passengers were kept at Minsk airport for hours as their luggage and paperwork were checked. 
""We were eight hours there. We didn't get any information what happened, only what we could find on the internet,"" one passenger told Reuters. 
Ryanair flight FR4978 finally landed in Vilnius at about 21:30.
Mr Protasevich is a former editor of media Nexta, a media operation with a Telegram channel. He left Belarus in 2019 to live in exile in Lithuania. From there he covered the events of the 2020 Belarus presidential election, after which he was charged with terrorism and inciting riots.",,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57180275,Belarus Ryanair flight diverted: Passengers describe panic on board

"His death in London came nearly 20 years after his last directorial effort, Heritage. The film had its UK premiere at the Khalili Theatre of the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas) in 2004. 
Centred on the trade in African artefacts fuelled by the international art market, the film feels prescient in light of the current debate about the restitution of African art treasures from museums of the West. 
Ladebo felt strongly about the issue, comparing looted African art to someone stealing the Statue of Liberty. 
He argued that the loss of artefacts had an adverse impact on societal cohesion, as the objects were made for cultural purposes and their absence could only be detrimental, due to the removal of vital information pertaining to a people's journey. 
He did not spare the Nigerian elite in what he called the ""social crisis"" of art theft, pointing to acts of complicity in the illicit trade. 
He was similarly unimpressed by African governments, which he accused of lacking seriousness about arts and culture, decrying their failure to accord museums their proper place in the education system. 
Ladebo believed a realistic outcome for Nigeria would be part-return or part-purchase arrangements with Western museums. He further suggested periodical travelling exhibitions that would allow people to see the artefacts in their homeland. 
But the ground has since shifted significantly. The debate over the Benin Bronzes has reached unprecedented levels, and developments are unfolding which might have seemed unthinkable a couple of years ago. 
Germany is to return looted Benin Bronzes to Nigeria; so is the University of Aberdeen as well as several institutions, especially museums, from the UK to Europe and America. 
In the current atmosphere, it is reasonable to think that Ladebo, too, would be much more strident today in his reckoning of an issue that preoccupied him so much he made a film about it, pumping much of his family savings into the project. 
The director and producer had hoped to work with Swiss backers to make a series of documentaries titled, Who Owns Art and Culture? However, it does not appear anything came of the arrangement. 
Heritage suffered the fate of much of his filmography - made with passion and idealism but seen by few. 
Born Raymond Oladipupo Ladebo in the city of Ijebu-Ode in Nigeria's Ogun State, the director obtained business and marketing degrees from US universities, and worked as a media analyst and accounts executive before going into films in collaboration with African-American actor Ossie Davis, who described Ladebo as a son-in-law. 
Their greatest collaboration was on the film Countdown At Kusini (1976), co-written by Ladebo and directed by Davis, who also starred in the film alongside Ruby Dee. 
Countdown At Kusini was the first of its kind in many ways, and its unique place in the history of black cinema is now an acknowledged fact. 
""The first film to be made by Black Americans and Africans working together on African soil, Kusini gives us a rare glimpse of the modern reality of Africa. All film was done in and around Lagos, Nigeria,"" noted the US newspaper, Ann Arbor Sun, in 1976. 
A conscious Pan-African production conceived to counter stereotypical portrayals of African Americans particularly in the Blaxploitation films of the early 1970s, Kusini was the first film ever to be funded by a black women's organisation, the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, in a case of crowdfunding and media activism that was ahead of its time. 
But for all the good intentions, Kusini's backers had not banked on non-committal Hollywood distributors and theatres, as the film was pulled summarily from the cinema by Columbia Pictures. 
When Kusini was shown at the Diaspora Festival of Black and Independent Film in the US in 2018, it was its first screening in 30 years. 
Many older Nigerians fondly remember Ladebo's iconic film, Bisi - Daughter of the River (1977), a vehicle for British-Nigerian actress, Patti Boulaye, in the high point of Nigerian cinema.
The economic downturn and Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) of the 1980s led to a steep decline in Nigeria's cinema culture.
By the time another generation rose to build a new Nigerian movie industry from the ashes in the 1990s, it would be reborn as video films. 
The new practitioners, in what would become known as Nollywood, were moving away from the practice and aesthetics of the likes of Ladebo, taking the audience with them. 
As he told the BBC's Masterpiece programme in 2005, Ladebo admired the ingenuity of the early Nollywood marketers in cracking the problem of distribution, but he never cast his lot with the video film industry. 
Celluloid, he said, was ""cleaner and requires a different discipline."" Heritage was shot in 16mm. No doubt, he was also cautious about access to his films because of the scourge of piracy in the Nigerian film distribution chain. 
After 1977, he stuck to making what he called advocacy films, usually in collaboration with funder organisations such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) and the UN Population Fund (UNPFA). 
His 1992 production, Vendor, won four awards, including Best Director and Best Feature at the first Nigerian Film Festival in the same year. 
Ladebo was among the very last of the visionary directors of Nigeria's early big-screen era, and was an important bridge between the different incarnations of the country's film industry - from celluloid to video and digital. 
He is survived by his wife, Irene, three daughters and two grandchildren. ",,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-57156147,Ladi Ladebo: A pioneer of Nigerian cinema

"During our 30-year armed struggle for independence, we lived with war every hour of every day. 
We got used to pain and sacrifice. Many of us were wounded two or three times during fighting. We were quickly patched up and marched into more battles.
I still wonder how we managed to cover ground from Qarora - the northern tip of Eritrea - to Dumeira - the southern tip - sleeping in trenches and climbing every mountain and valley. I was among the fortunate ones. About 65,000 of our fighters died in combat.
I joined the liberation army as a 16-year-old in 1982 after hearing tales about Ethiopian aggression and jealous of the glamourous image of the freedom fighters with their long hair, shorts and AK47s. 
I received a few months of training in the Arag valley. We learned how to attack and retreat, how to camouflage ourselves, and how to use weapons - including grenades and RPGs. 
Our training was good. It was backed up by political education, including how we would establish a democratic government.
I was involved in numerous battles, culminating with the liberation of the port city of Massawa in the Fenqel operation of February 1990. That operation was decisive. It put a stranglehold on the Ethiopian military's movements, and ultimately forced them out of Eritrea.
We fought intense battles for 72 hours to capture this strategic city, and we then defended it for more than a year with 100km-long trenches. In these battles, I suffered shrapnel wounds to my head and hand. I was treated in hospital. After I was discharged I returned to the battlefield.
Towards the end of the 1990s I was sent to join the cultural group to boost the morale of our army with revolutionary songs and dramas. In 1991, we were on Dahlak Island, near Massawa, when we heard the biggest news of our lives - we had finally achieved our independence. 
Filled with joy, we travelled by boat to Massawa. We were then loaded on to lorries to go to the capital, Asmara - a journey that took about three hours. We crossed the Ethiopian military's southern checkpoint. It was unmanned, the Ethiopian soldiers had abandoned it.
There was a dreamlike atmosphere in Asmara. People in the city dropped everything to welcome the independence fighters. They broke into impromptu ""guayla"" (traditional music and dance) on the streets of the capital, as well as other towns and villages.
Before that momentous day, the people of Asmara were totally besieged. The airport was constantly being bombed, there was a strict curfew. Then on 24 May everything changed. 
Mothers abandoned earthen pots on their ""fernello"" (coal stoves); forgot the fire in the ""mogogo"" (ovens) and walked out on their coffee rituals to join the welcome party.
People carrying palm leaves, which are often used in celebrations, invaded the streets - every palm tree was stripped. The young ones climbed onto the tanks that rolled in and waved their palm leaves.
The celebrations went on for days and nights.
There was much anxiety amid the euphoria as there were many parents out in the streets with picture frames in their hands. They were asking the arriving fighters about the whereabouts of their children. 
""Did they make it back? Did they die?"" 
I remember Seyum Tsehaye, the designated fighter photographer, taking pictures of the momentous occasion as his unit rolled in. 
I also remember two members of our unit - Gedle and Abayey - coming face-to-face with their family members while they were still on the back of the lorry. The joy, the screams, the tears. 
Gedle's father was so overjoyed he beat his chest with his palm branch.
""I found my son! I found my son!"" was all that came out of his mouth as he ran in front of our lorry.  Abayey, the female fighter who was in the driver's compartment, recognised her mother-in-law and tried to jump off the lorry, almost injuring herself. 
We were accompanied by cheering crowds all the way to Albergo Ciao - a hotel in the city.
Later, we were told by our commanders that we could go out and look for our family members - those of us who had relatives in town. It was not easy to find them in a couple of hours, after years away. But we did.
We all hoped that Eritrea was going to flourish and we would live happily ever after. 
Unfortunately, it did not take long for our hopes to be dashed. We gave everything we had - our youth and lives - to achieve independence. We had dreams. 
Many of us wanted to go to our families, resume our studies, take up civilian jobs, form a family and do well in our communities. We were very surprised that we were not even allowed to leave the army.
We were told that the country had nothing. ""All we have is the armaments we brought in with us,"" our commanders-turned-leaders told us. 
After such a long and arduous life in the battlefields, we, the ex-fighters, were once again asked to tighten our belts. We were instructed to continue our work unpaid. We were only given food. This lasted for about two years, and then we started getting some money. 
The fighters who functioned as one family unit during the revolutionary years were dismayed when they became aware of the leaders' behaviour - many were simply having a good time as soon as the country was liberated.  
Some top leaders were seen in bars, drinking excessively - enjoying themselves while the regular fighters struggled. The chain of  command and the regular meetings were neglected. 
The ordinary ""tegadelti"" (freedom fighters) waited patiently for their conditions to change but nothing happened. 
In 1993, on the eve of the second anniversary of Eritrea's independence, the ex-fighters protested and asked their leaders to listen to their grievances.  They forced their leaders to call a meeting in Asmara's main stadium. 
""We understand your problems; it is a common problem; we will resolve the situation together,"" was the answer given. 
As soon as the protest was over, the leaders secretly detained the protest leaders - one by one over a few days.  Soon after, they were sentenced to jail terms ranging from one to 15 years. 
They paid a heavy price for highlighting their plight - they ended up becoming victims. Many said that the regime was following a path to dictatorship; others called for patience, saying the constitution that Eritreans had been promised would be drafted and the country would head towards democracy.  
None of this has happened. Eritrea remains a one-party state, having never held an election to choose the president or government. 
In the meantime, Eritrea has found itself at war with all its neighbours at some point - Yemen in 1995, Sudan in 1996, Ethiopia from 1998 to 2000 and Djibouti in 2008. The country lost tens of thousands more young lives.
Now, Eritrean troops are involved in the fifth conflict since independence.  They are in Ethiopia's Tigray region, fighting alongside Ethiopian troops against the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).
The TPLF was in power in Ethiopia when Eritrea's independence was formalised in a referendum in 1993, and during the 1998-2000 border war between two nations.
In the immediate aftermath of independence, I joined a ruling party-supported cultural troupe, hoping to honour freedom fighters and help build the country.  I wrote plays and songs, and took part in performances. One of Eritrea's most famous musicians, Helen Milles, sang one of my songs: Massawa - Where are your Precious Children?
Later, I worked as a journalist for a government-owned newspaper until I went into exile.
The little political space that existed came to an end after the Ethiopia-Eritrea border war. 
The government became gripped by a siege mentality, as it feared destabilisation from Ethiopia and accountability from its own citizens over a conflict that many believed could have been avoided through dialogue.
In September 2001, the government ordered a crackdown. Eleven top officials and many middle-ranking cadres who supported the idea of reform were arrested. Later they were thrown into prisons, never to be heard of again. 
Eleven journalists who were publishing the grievances, letters and calls of the reformist group were also detained; their newspapers banned. Among them was my good friend and colleague Seyum, the photographer who captured the momentous time of independence. 
None of them were brought to an independent court and their whereabouts remain unknown.
Eritrea remains a one-party state that has not held a national election since independence. There is no free press or independent civil society groups. All international NGOs and local civic organisations are banned. 
Official statistics show that healthcare and education have improved since independence but is it difficult to believe them. With limited job prospects and the prospect of years of compulsory unpaid military service, many young people continue to leave the country, seeking asylum in other African states or Europe.
But many of us have not given up hope. We believe change is inevitable and Eritrea will realise the promises made by its martyrs.",,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-57187736,Eritrea viewpoint: I fought for independence but I'm still waiting for freedom
"EU leaders are due to discuss their response to what the union's executive called a ""hijacking"" and the US state department said was ""a shocking act"".
Belarus scrambled a fighter jet to force the plane - bound for Lithuania - to land, claiming a bomb threat.
Police took Roman Protasevich away when passengers disembarked. 
The 26-year-old was aboard the Ryanair plane, which was flying from the Greek capital, Athens. The aircraft was due to land in Vilnius, but was still in Belarusian airspace when it was told to divert to Minsk, the capital of Belarus. 
Witnesses said the activist was ""super-scared"" and told fellow passengers he would face the death penalty - Belarus is the only European country that still executes prisoners.
State media in Belarus said 
 for the move. The plane landed in Vilnius more than six hours after its scheduled arrival.
Since winning a disputed election last August, Mr Lukashenko, 66, who has ruled the country since 1994, has cracked down on dissenting voices. Many opposition figures have been arrested, while others fled into exile.
The incident drew sharp condemnation from across the European Union, with countries urging the immediate release of Mr Protasevich and a full investigation. The EU later summoned the Belarusian ambassador and informed him of the bloc's ""firm condemnation"".
Lithuania has advised its citizens against travel to Belarus, and urged those already in the country to leave. It has ordered all flights to and from Lithuanian airports to avoid the airspace of Belarus, its eastern neighbour. 
Dozens of Belarusian officials, including President Lukashenko, are already under EU sanctions including travel bans and asset freezes, imposed in response to the repression on opponents.
Flight FR4978 turned east to Minsk shortly before it reached the Lithuanian border. Greece and Lithuania put the number of passengers on board at 171.
In a statement, Irish carrier Ryanair said the crew had been ""notified by Belarus (Air Traffic Control) of a potential security threat on board and were instructed to divert to the nearest airport, Minsk"".
But Tadeusz Giczan - the editor of Nexta, the media outlet Mr Protasevich used to work for - tweeted that 
.
Franak Viacorka, a friend and associate of Mr Protasevich, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the journalist ""already felt something bad"" in Athens airport because he had seen that someone was following him.
Some passengers described seeing Mr Protasevich looking nervous as the incident unfolded. ""He just turned to people and said he was facing the death penalty,"" Monika Simkiene told AFP news agency.
Another passenger told Reuters news agency that Mr Protasevich had opened an overhead locker after they were told of the diversion, pulled out a laptop and a phone and gave them to a female companion. 
Mr Viacorka said the woman, who was Mr Protasevich's girlfriend and was arrested with him, was ""not involved at all in anything, but they will be pursuing her because she's a close person to him"". She has been named as Sofia Sapega, a Russian citizen.
""This was a case of state-sponsored hijacking... state-sponsored piracy,"" Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary told Irish Newstalk radio on Monday.
""It appears the intent of the authorities was to remove a journalist and his travelling companion... we believe there were some KGB agents offloaded at the airport as well,"" Mr O'Leary said.
EU leaders are expected to discuss the incident at a summit in Brussels later on Monday. Nato ambassadors are due to meet on Tuesday.
A package of measures being worked on includes a ban on overflights of Belarus, a ban on entry to European airports by national carrier Belavia and a suspension of ground transport links, French officials say.
Ursula von der Leyen, head of the European Commission, said ""the outrageous and illegal behaviour... will have consequences"". 
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda urged the EU to impose fresh economic sanctions. He told the BBC this ""could make a larger impact on the behaviour of the Belarusian regime"".
Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said actions not words, and sanctions with ""a real edge"" were needed.
""We cannot allow this incident to pass on the basis of warnings or strong press releases,"" he told state broadcaster RTE.
UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Mr Protasevich had been arrested ""on the basis of a ruse"" and called for his immediate release.
Mr Protasevich is a former editor of Nexta, a media operation with a Telegram channel. He left Belarus in 2019 to live in exile in Lithuania. From there he covered the events of the 2020 presidential election, after which he was charged with terrorism and inciting riots.
Nexta played a key role for the opposition during the vote, which was won by Mr Lukashenko and is widely regarded as rigged. It has continued to do so in its aftermath, particularly with the government imposing news blackouts. 
But he first attracted the attention of the authorities as a teenager, being expelled from school after taking part in a protest in 2011.
Mr Protasevich now works for a different Telegram channel, Belamova. He stepped in to write for it after blogger Igor Losik was arrested by the Belarusian authorities in June last year.
He was in Athens to attend an economic conference along with Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the opposition leader who claimed victory in the election. She too now lives in exile in Lithuania.
 It has its ally Russia to the east and Ukraine to the south. To the north and west lie EU and Nato members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.
 Like Ukraine, this nation of 9.5 million is caught in rivalry between the West and Russia. President Lukashenko has been nicknamed ""Europe's last dictator"" - he has been in power for 27 years.
 There is a huge opposition movement demanding new, democratic leadership and economic reform. The opposition movement and Western governments say Mr Lukashenko rigged the 9 August election. Officially he won by a landslide. A huge police crackdown has curbed street protests and sent opposition leaders to prison or into exile.
